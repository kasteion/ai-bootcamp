We'll discuss going from\\n    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer\\n    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building\\n    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience\\n    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,\\n    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur\\n    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It's\\n    a pleasure to have you here.\\n  sec: 71\\n  time: '1:11'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,\\n    actually. I think we've known each other for some time. I'm really happy to be\\n    here.\\n  sec: 112\\n  time: '1:52'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s background\\n- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]\\n    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let's start with\\n    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n  sec: 122\\n  time: '2:02'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening\\n    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s\\n    and Master's degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes\\n    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the\\n    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master's degree,\\n    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: '2:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That's where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.\\n    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering\\n    part, which I loved, but I didn't enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched\\n    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time\\n    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,\\n    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that's\\n    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with\\n    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people\\n    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That's where all\\n    my engineering background comes from.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: '2:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That's\\n    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don't you start something?” and\\n    that's when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there's a startup\\n    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,\\n    it's pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself\\n    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it's kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.\\n    [chuckles] I'm more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find\\n    a CEO match.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: '2:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for\\n    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well\\n    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch\\n    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went\\n    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It's like\\n    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: '2:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is compliance?\\n  sec: 300\\n  time: '5:00'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Basically, it's KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to\\n    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?\\n    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was\\n    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,\\n    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident\\n    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,\\n    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American\\n    startup, but it didn't work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really\\n    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: '5:02'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody\\n    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”\\n    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake\\n    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something\\n    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,\\n    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we\\n    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,\\n    but I didn't feel that it was for me, so I left.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: '5:02'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That's when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.\\n    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they\\n    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it's a beauty brand. There,\\n    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.\\n    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: '5:02'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing\\n- line: That's quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start\\n    telling us what you do now, it's also interesting to know – how did you decide\\n    what you want to do as a freelancer?\\n  sec: 433\\n  time: '7:13'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What\\n    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went\\n    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,\\n    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.\\n    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late\\n    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people\\n    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to\\n    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I'm like, “No, I don't want to be hired.\\n    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: '7:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti\\n    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So\\n    I'm like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don't know how, but I managed\\n    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing\\n    for the company. Now, it's also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)\\n    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back\\n    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that's how\\n    it started. They are a SaaS company. It's a completely different business model\\n    than what I'm used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: '7:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really\\n    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help\\n    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could\\n    attract. I didn't even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,\\n    “Okay, let's just leave and figure this out.”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: '7:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That's quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what\\n    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 580\\n  time: '9:40'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: '[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated\\n    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client\\n    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I\\n    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still\\n    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.'\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: '9:53'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,\\n    “I don't have clients. I don't have income.” I was tapping into my savings and\\n    I started panicking. Of course, I didn't announce to anybody that I was freelancing.\\n    So how should anybody know about that?\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: '9:53'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients\\n- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?\\n  sec: 644\\n  time: '10:44'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly! I didn't announce it on LinkedIn. I didn't tell anybody. I mean,\\n    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at\\n    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if\\n    I can't make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit\\n    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I'm freelancing right now, but not\\n    like, “Hey, I'm a data freelancer. I'm here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series\\n    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 647\\n  time: '10:47'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for\\n    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps\\n    to get noticed, right?\\n  sec: 690\\n  time: '11:30'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it's crazy how many\\n    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it's\\n    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing\\n    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when\\n    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated\\n    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I\\n    think, and I got two clients out of that.\\n  sec: 701\\n  time: '11:41'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?\\n  sec: 746\\n  time: '12:26'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,\\n    but I have a closed Instagram. It's a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a\\n    professional thing. I was like, “It's so uncomfortable.” But that's the thing,\\n    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,\\n    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then\\n    I didn't care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.\\n    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you're doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.\\n    Okay, then let's do more selfies.” [laughs]\\n  sec: 749\\n  time: '12:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I still don't know if I'll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because\\n    it’s so awkward, at least to me.\\n  sec: 792\\n  time: '13:12'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let's just see\\n    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.\\n  sec: 800\\n  time: '13:20'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer\\n    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?\\n  sec: 812\\n  time: '13:32'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: That's funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It's kind of\\n    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was\\n    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted\\n    – and that's so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that\\n    it's also hard for me to understand what pain point I'm solving exactly. So that\\n    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted\\n    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure\\n    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.\\n    So it's not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for\\n    the data that they have.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: '13:41'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It's completely different. It's not direct-to-consumer. It's completely different\\n    things. And that's so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client\\n    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate\\n    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but\\n    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to\\n    end. It's like an internal data team basically.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: '13:41'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants\\n    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens\\n    that they don't chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me\\n    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just\\n    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,\\n    that I can offer – and that's why it's hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: '13:41'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.\\n  sec: 953\\n  time: '15:53'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, exactly. It's more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something\\n    like that, you really need to understand who you're targeting and then adjust\\n    the messaging for them. Because if it's too broad, people don't feel that they\\n    are being addressed.\\n  sec: 957\\n  time: '15:57'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: You're still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer\\n    brands?\\n  sec: 975\\n  time: '16:15'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I try to, because that's where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.\\n    Yeah.\\n  sec: 981\\n  time: '16:21'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career\\n- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty\\n    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least\\n    you didn't tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you\\n    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data\\n    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: '16:30'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.\\n    I don’t know, you didn't work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or\\n    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it's like everything. Also,\\n    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That's a lot. Maybe the question I have\\n    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: '16:30'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested\\n    in so many areas?\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: '16:30'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That's this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist\\n    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want\\n    to have in my deep learning model. I'm not excited about that. You immediately\\n    see on my face, I'm like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting\\n    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data\\n    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing\\n    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole\\n    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those\\n    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,\\n    yes and some of the stuff, no.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: '17:35'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then it also starts to be – I'm not a profile for corporate companies, for\\n    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over\\n    the time – I'm not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I'm not the best fit.\\n    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don't want to do\\n    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,\\n    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them\\n    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics\\n    or go to the tech team and speak their language.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: '17:35'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That's so funny, because bioinformatics, it's a bridge between informaticians\\n    and biologists because those two don't know how to communicate with each other.\\n    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but\\n    doesn't know anything in depth. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: '17:35'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?\\n    Or do you think it's fine?\\n  sec: 1176\\n  time: '19:36'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: If you're a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep\\n    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you're internally\\n    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you\\n    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the\\n    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy\\n    right now.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: '19:49'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction\\n    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let's say, from Shopify and packs the raw data\\n    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase\\n    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to\\n    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client\\n    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I'm like, “Yes.” I'm\\n    just super happy about this. Once you're happy, you're going this extra mile,\\n    and you're enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: '19:49'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Connecting business and data\\n- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least\\n    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed\\n    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.\\n    That's correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?\\n  sec: 1282\\n  time: '21:22'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, right now I'm focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.\\n    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and\\n    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and\\n    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What\\n    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How\\n    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?\\n    But I know exactly what the steps there are.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: '21:49'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business\\n    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,\\n    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I'm working with\\n    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What\\n    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”\\n    That’s easier stuff, but that's what they need to know in order to understand\\n    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never\\n    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not\\n    there.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: '21:49'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients\\n- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.\\n    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,\\n    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”\\n  sec: 1389\\n  time: '23:09'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: 'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three\\n    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in\\n    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I''m addressing\\n    them. You don''t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my\\n    audience? What''s the type of voice I''m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and\\n    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.'\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: '23:26'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and\\n    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting\\n    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest\\n    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That's where internally I had to\\n    struggle with myself. That's where you also realize that might be the point when\\n    you're getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: '23:26'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who\\n    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice\\n    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?\\n    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe\\n    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.\\n  sec: 1488\\n  time: '24:48'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I'm loud. I love laughing.\\n    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional\\n    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That's what I thought – I wanted\\n    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,\\n    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: '25:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that\\n    I don't want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying\\n    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package\\n    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone\\n    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as\\n    well, at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: '25:15'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1584\\n  time: '26:24'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Oh, no. It's super ad hoc-ey, right? It's not even stupid joking. It's rather\\n    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You\\n    just start to be friends with those people, right? It's so funny, with all my\\n    clients, with the older teams, I'm in a really good relationship, and they are\\n    super happy to see me and I'm also super happy to see them. So you start to have\\n    those internal jokes at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1589\\n  time: '26:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I'm trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience\\n    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don't seem super\\n    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four\\n    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching\\n    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different\\n    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don't seem very related?\\n  sec: 1623\\n  time: '27:03'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows\\n    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind\\n    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,\\n    “Okay, she's technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands\\n    me immediately.” That's what I meant. It's hard for me and that's what I need\\n    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: '27:45'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: At the end of the day, what do I really want to do? Fundraising is super tiresome.\\n    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to\\n    submit everything to the investor. It's not this dream job. It's super intense.\\n    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job\\n    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I'm enjoying the most where\\n    I don't burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part\\n    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that\\n    I attract the right audience as well.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: '27:45'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s work in fundraising\\n- line: But for you as a generalist, what you enjoy now might not be the same as what\\n    you enjoy tomorrow, right? How do you live with this? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1750\\n  time: '29:10'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah. Yes, exactly. That's a good question. Right now, I know that fundraising\\n    is fun and that's where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors\\n    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it's super\\n    intense. Let's put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also\\n    people – who you work with.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: '29:21'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: All my clients are super fun, nice people. Sometimes, of course, there are\\n    some parts that I don't enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I'm like,\\n    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.\\n    That's where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.\\n    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn't happen every day.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: '29:21'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What kind of work exactly do you do for fundraising? I guess it's somehow\\n    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these\\n    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look\\n    in the future.” So you're still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.\\n    Right?\\n  sec: 1826\\n  time: '30:26'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active\\n    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort\\n    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there\\n    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which\\n    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird\\n    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don't find it weird.”\\n    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,\\n    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,\\n    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.\\n    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.\\n    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.\\n  sec: 1845\\n  time: '30:45'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Cohorts and KPIs\\n- line: Do you have any examples of these cohorts and KPIs? Maybe it doesn't have\\n    to come from a specific client, but just to understand what exactly you do.\\n  sec: 1906\\n  time: '31:46'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but\\n    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then\\n    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question\\n    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That's where you define\\n    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those\\n    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in\\n    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you're\\n    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is\\n    it the traffic that marketing's attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then\\n    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just\\n    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”\\n  sec: 1915\\n  time: '31:55'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, first it's about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,\\n    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what's\\n    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?\\n  sec: 1991\\n  time: '33:11'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That's so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising\\n    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some\\n    of the stuff we never implemented – it's only for fundraising. But yeah, it's\\n    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how\\n    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?\\n  sec: 2012\\n  time: '33:32'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Improving communication between the data and business teams\\n- line: We spoke about fundraising to some extent, but I'm also curious about the\\n    other three parts, especially this coaching data and the business team aspect.\\n    How is it similar? How is it related? What do you do there?\\n  sec: 2043\\n  time: '34:03'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: This project will be… I'm not doing it right now, it's one of the future projects.\\n    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It's like six, seven years\\n    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it's\\n    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.\\n    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain\\n    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.\\n    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they\\n    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need\\n    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.\\n    And then they don't understand just what the business team needs because they\\n    don't have time to understand the business.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: '34:16'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Those people are not business savvy. That's the thing, you have engineers\\n    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are\\n    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that's where I try to help.\\n    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,\\n    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties\\n    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it's already a success at the\\n    end of the day. It's also hard for me to measure the success because what I do\\n    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you\\n    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes\\n    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: '34:16'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So you kind of act as a translator – you translate from one language to another.\\n    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between\\n    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,\\n    and you help somebody else achieve the same.\\n  sec: 2170\\n  time: '36:10'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. That's exactly what I was doing with bioinformatics as well – helping\\n    those informaticians and  biologists actually to make sure that this whole thing\\n    works together.\\n  sec: 2189\\n  time: '36:29'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Motivating every link in the company’s chain\\n- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being\\n    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you've done\\n    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if\\n    you don't do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would\\n    approach this. So that's one thing, I think, that can help you in your current\\n    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?\\n  sec: 2203\\n  time: '36:43'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That's so funny, people\\n    know that I know best practices. but I don't know… I know what doesn't work for\\n    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the\\n    patterns, and you're like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we'll\\n    struggle with that. So let's not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn't work\\n    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let's call\\n    them “disasters,” in the future.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: '37:14'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Also, it's all about the people's communication. You just adjust to how people\\n    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That's why, with\\n    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with\\n    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to\\n    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches\\n    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every\\n    person, basically.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: '37:14'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: The cons of freelancing\\n- line: Are there any cons of freelancing? Are there any cons of being a generalist\\n    when freelancing right now?\\n  sec: 2325\\n  time: '38:45'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what\\n    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation\\n    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also\\n    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood\\n    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn't work that way.\\n  sec: 2336\\n  time: '38:56'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That’s too bad. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2366\\n  time: '39:26'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. [chuckle] So I think it's hard for me to sell this generalistic thing\\n    because there are lots of other agencies or freelancers who have a very specialized\\n    focus and then people ask me, “What is the difference between you and them?\\n  sec: 2367\\n  time: '39:27'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is a data agency?\\n  sec: 2390\\n  time: '39:50'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands\\n    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may\\n    also might help a bit with the tracking. I'm kind of competing with them, but\\n    on the other hand, I'm not. Because I'm not going against the typical data engineer\\n    – I'm more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things\\n    out and then implement.\\n  sec: 2393\\n  time: '39:53'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they\\n    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,\\n    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I\\n    don't know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?\\n  sec: 2429\\n  time: '40:29'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, that's the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies\\n    don't sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell\\n    dashboards. And that's what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?\\n    What is in the back? They're like, “I don't care. I just want this fancy dashboard\\n    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured\\n    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level\\n    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech\\n    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how\\n    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That's the thing, again, adjusting the\\n    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2447\\n  time: '40:47'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So how do you compete with them? By making selfies? [Jekaterina laughs] Posting\\n    selfies on LinkedIn? Because I don't think they do this, right? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2504\\n  time: '41:44'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I'm more on the business side. I\\n    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at\\n    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which\\n    is experience that those agencies don't have – operationally being involved in\\n    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).\\n    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,\\n    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that's where I get\\n    involved immediately.\\n  sec: 2512\\n  time: '41:52'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Balancing projects and networking\\n- line: Okay. We have a few more questions. A question from Claire, “What are the\\n    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”\\n  sec: 2560\\n  time: '42:40'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don't be confused by this “free”\\n    prefix in “freelancing”. You're free in terms of choosing who you work with and\\n    when you work, but that doesn't mean that you will now surf for a week and then\\n    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn't work, because you need to work\\n    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing\\n    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them\\n    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make\\n    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: '42:51'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That's why there's not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the\\n    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people\\n    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they\\n    want to solve the problem. I'm really intrigued by those kinds of people. The\\n    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without\\n    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that\\n    doesn't mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute\\n    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.\\n    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,\\n    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: '42:51'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you deal with this stress? By planning things?\\n  sec: 2685\\n  time: '44:45'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.\\n    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing\\n    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term\\n    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where\\n    you don't know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or\\n    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don't\\n    have any savings. That's hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.\\n  sec: 2689\\n  time: '44:49'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Or at least if you have a client lined up for the next half a year. Right?\\n  sec: 2738\\n  time: '45:38'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it's fine. The hardest part… if you don't have clients,\\n    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You\\n    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits\\n    hard.\\n  sec: 2743\\n  time: '45:43'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What do you do for that? How do you deal with this?\\n  sec: 2765\\n  time: '46:05'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”\\n    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where\\n    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the\\n    freelancers networks? What should I do?”\\n  sec: 2769\\n  time: '46:09'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Like Fiverr, right? These kinds of places?\\n  sec: 2787\\n  time: '46:27'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of\\n    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and\\n    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2788\\n  time: '46:28'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That if you don't, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?\\n  sec: 2805\\n  time: '46:45'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. But that's the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn't\\n    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,\\n    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They\\n    feel good about me.” So that's when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable\\n    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started\\n    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,\\n    once I got out of my comfort zone. That's the thing. Oh! One more thing that's\\n    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m\\n    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation\\n    process. You come in and what I'm used to at Gitti, but had been working there\\n    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.\\n    With every new client, I don't have this freedom. I don't have this trust. So\\n    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.\\n    It takes time. That's where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant\\n    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”\\n  sec: 2808\\n  time: '46:48'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Yeah, it does sound very hard. Do you work more now than compared to previously?\\n  sec: 2895\\n  time: '48:15'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Yes, I do work more. That's the thing, chatting with people – do you\\n    consider that work or not work? Growing this audience.\\n  sec: 2903\\n  time: '48:23'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Networking. Yeah. Okay.\\n  sec: 2915\\n  time: '48:35'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- header: The importance of enjoying what you do\\n- line: That's the question – you, as a person, are you happy doing that? If you're\\n    happy doing that, if you enjoy having three coffee meetings during the day in\\n    different parts of the city and you're running around like crazy – and you need\\n    to come to those meetings as if you're fresh, energized. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2916\\n  time: '48:36'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you still need to do work for other clients. Right?\\n  sec: 2938\\n  time: '48:58'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. Again, if it makes you happy, if you have the energy for that – and\\n    you need to create this energy, energy doesn't come from out of the blue – then\\n    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn't matter how long you will work at the\\n    end of the day. But it's also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That's\\n    the thing, chatting with people – I don't see that as working hours. But for those\\n    hours, currently, I'm not paid either.\\n  sec: 2941\\n  time: '49:01'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you create this energy? Where do you get it from?\\n  sec: 2971\\n  time: '49:31'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don't know. [laughs]\\n  sec: 2974\\n  time: '49:34'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you just naturally come refreshed to every meeting?\\n  sec: 2981\\n  time: '49:41'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No, the thing is that I think before joining Gitti, I was calmer and maybe\\n    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That's what I love about\\n    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I\\n    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone\\n    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it's\\n    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure\\n    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don't need to be sad. I don't need to\\n    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.\\n    That's where I am now. I'm super happy with what I'm doing again. This happiness\\n    creates the energy at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2984\\n  time: '49:44'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: In some ways, the secret is positive self-talk. Right?\\n  sec: 3057\\n  time: '50:57'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: '[chuckles] Exactly. But that''s the thing, if you start doubting yourself,\\n    that''s the most negative energy that you can have. It will not help further.'\\n  sec: 3062\\n  time: '51:02'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Growing the client base\\n- line: Sarah wrote a comment “Passion and desire to help and the impact in many trials\\n    is so fulfilling.” [Jekaterina agrees] This is a good summary. So you said that\\n    in addition to “work,” meaning helping clients, you also need to grow your client\\n    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.\\n    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from\\n    Wilhelm is, “How do you reach out for new clients? How do you grow your client\\n    base?”\\n  sec: 3076\\n  time: '51:16'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don't do cold outreach. This is hard. This is annoying. This makes me sad\\n    – when somebody doesn't answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with\\n    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack\\n    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about\\n    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,\\n    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several\\n    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed\\n    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn't care about their profiles.\\n    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking\\n    helped a bit. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 3113\\n  time: '51:53'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It's like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,\\n    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that\\n    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you\\n    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And\\n    then they decide to talk to you themselves?\\n  sec: 3177\\n  time: '52:57'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I mean, the conversion rate from 250 people to 2 people is super small,\\n    I agree. But it's fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible\\n    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have\\n    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that\\n    question. I'm also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions\\n    and I also jumped on that. I'm like, “Okay, let me help you.”\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: '53:21'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: There’s one potential client – well, not even potential, but we just chatted\\n    with her – her freelancer for Google Analytics is not answering her and she has\\n    a project where she wants to move from GA3 to GA4 and adjust some stuff. So I\\n    was like, “Hey, let's have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might\\n    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just\\n    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and\\n    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen\\n    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: '53:21'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, so networking – helping and stalking people on LinkedIn. [chuckles]\\n    That's your secret?\\n  sec: 3289\\n  time: '54:49'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: '[laughs] And selfies. Don’t forget selfies.'\\n  sec: 3295\\n  time: '54:55'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: In the office work vs working remotely\\n- line: Selfies, yeah. That's the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is\\n    it always within Berlin in an office?\\n  sec: 3299\\n  time: '54:59'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I love being in the office. That's where this whole energy is great – this\\n    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will\\n    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I'm trying to always do 100%. So either 100%\\n    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still\\n    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere\\n    else. I still don't know.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: '55:08'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That's where the “free” comes\\n    in. If I'm able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for\\n    them, and I don't need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.\\n    This is also amazing. That's where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in\\n    “freelance” comes in.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: '55:08'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s advice who people who feel stuck\\n- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions\\n    that we prepared. I don't know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes\\n    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people\\n    who feel stuck at what they're doing?\\n  sec: 3371\\n  time: '56:11'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Don't sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don't quit today. [chuckles] Don't\\n    do that. Let's say you're a machine learning engineer, and you're like, “I'm a\\n    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.\\n    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting\\n    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.\\n    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,\\n    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told\\n    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with\\n    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don't sit on the\\n    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also\\n    fine.\\n  sec: 3390\\n  time: '56:30'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: If you feel stuck and you want to be a freelancer, this is what you should\\n    do? In general – talk to people, right?\\n  sec: 3454\\n  time: '57:34'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But that's the thing, even if you don't want to do freelancing. Just start\\n    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with\\n    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.\\n  sec: 3462\\n  time: '57:42'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s resource recommendations\\n- line: Is there any book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners?\\n  sec: 3483\\n  time: '58:03'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: 'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s\\n    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.\\n    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with\\n    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments\\n    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what\\n    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book. I just read it recently.'\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: '58:08'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So that's the general book and another one is more about marketing analytics,\\n    which is what I was doing the last few years. There's this guy in Google, who’s\\n    like the Senior Director of Strategic Analytics or something – Avinash Kaushik.\\n    So his blog and newsletters. That's just a bomb of knowledge. So for anyone who\\n    is interested in marketing analytics, that's the newsletter to read.\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: '58:08'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also usually ask what the best way to reach out to you is, but I think it's\\n    LinkedIn. Right? [Jekaterina confirms] We’ll include the link to your profile.\\n    I think that's all we have time for today. That was amazing – talking to you.\\n    You're very energetic. I feel the energy now. I can go and work and something.\\n    Great! Yeah, thanks for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks\\n    for telling your story. It was amazing. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us\\n    today. Have a great rest of your day!\\n  sec: 3564\\n  time: '59:24'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Thank you so much. Thank you for having me and have a nice day as well.\\n  sec: 3596\\n  time: '59:56'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n---\""

We\\'ll discuss going from\\n    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer\\n    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building\\n    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience\\n    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,\\n    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur\\n    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It\\'s\\n    a pleasure to have you here.\\n  sec: 71\\n  time: \\'1:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,\\n    actually. I think we\\'ve known each other for some time. I\\'m really happy to be\\n    here.\\n  sec: 112\\n  time: \\'1:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s background\\n- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]\\n    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let\\'s start with\\n    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n  sec: 122\\n  time: \\'2:02\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening\\n    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s\\n    and Master\\'s degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes\\n    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the\\n    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master\\'s degree,\\n    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.\\n    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering\\n    part, which I loved, but I didn\\'t enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched\\n    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time\\n    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,\\n    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that\\'s\\n    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with\\n    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people\\n    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That\\'s where all\\n    my engineering background comes from.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That\\'s\\n    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don\\'t you start something?” and\\n    that\\'s when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there\\'s a startup\\n    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,\\n    it\\'s pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself\\n    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it\\'s kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.\\n    [chuckles] I\\'m more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find\\n    a CEO match.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for\\n    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well\\n    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch\\n    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went\\n    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It\\'s like\\n    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is compliance?\\n  sec: 300\\n  time: \\'5:00\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Basically, it\\'s KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to\\n    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?\\n    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was\\n    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,\\n    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident\\n    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,\\n    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American\\n    startup, but it didn\\'t work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really\\n    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody\\n    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”\\n    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake\\n    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something\\n    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,\\n    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we\\n    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,\\n    but I didn\\'t feel that it was for me, so I left.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.\\n    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they\\n    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it\\'s a beauty brand. There,\\n    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.\\n    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing\\n- line: That\\'s quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start\\n    telling us what you do now, it\\'s also interesting to know – how did you decide\\n    what you want to do as a freelancer?\\n  sec: 433\\n  time: \\'7:13\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What\\n    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went\\n    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,\\n    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.\\n    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late\\n    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people\\n    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to\\n    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I\\'m like, “No, I don\\'t want to be hired.\\n    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti\\n    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So\\n    I\\'m like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don\\'t know how, but I managed\\n    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing\\n    for the company. Now, it\\'s also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)\\n    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back\\n    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that\\'s how\\n    it started. They are a SaaS company. It\\'s a completely different business model\\n    than what I\\'m used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really\\n    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help\\n    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could\\n    attract. I didn\\'t even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,\\n    “Okay, let\\'s just leave and figure this out.”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what\\n    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 580\\n  time: \\'9:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated\\n    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client\\n    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I\\n    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still\\n    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.\\'\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,\\n    “I don\\'t have clients. I don\\'t have income.” I was tapping into my savings and\\n    I started panicking. Of course, I didn\\'t announce to anybody that I was freelancing.\\n    So how should anybody know about that?\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients\\n- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?\\n  sec: 644\\n  time: \\'10:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly! I didn\\'t announce it on LinkedIn. I didn\\'t tell anybody. I mean,\\n    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at\\n    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if\\n    I can\\'t make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit\\n    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I\\'m freelancing right now, but not\\n    like, “Hey, I\\'m a data freelancer. I\\'m here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series\\n    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 647\\n  time: \\'10:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for\\n    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps\\n    to get noticed, right?\\n  sec: 690\\n  time: \\'11:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it\\'s crazy how many\\n    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it\\'s\\n    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing\\n    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when\\n    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated\\n    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I\\n    think, and I got two clients out of that.\\n  sec: 701\\n  time: \\'11:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?\\n  sec: 746\\n  time: \\'12:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,\\n    but I have a closed Instagram. It\\'s a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a\\n    professional thing. I was like, “It\\'s so uncomfortable.” But that\\'s the thing,\\n    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,\\n    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then\\n    I didn\\'t care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.\\n    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you\\'re doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.\\n    Okay, then let\\'s do more selfies.” [laughs]\\n  sec: 749\\n  time: \\'12:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I still don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because\\n    it’s so awkward, at least to me.\\n  sec: 792\\n  time: \\'13:12\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let\\'s just see\\n    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.\\n  sec: 800\\n  time: \\'13:20\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer\\n    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?\\n  sec: 812\\n  time: \\'13:32\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: That\\'s funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It\\'s kind of\\n    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was\\n    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted\\n    – and that\\'s so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that\\n    it\\'s also hard for me to understand what pain point I\\'m solving exactly. So that\\n    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted\\n    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure\\n    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.\\n    So it\\'s not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for\\n    the data that they have.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s completely different. It\\'s not direct-to-consumer. It\\'s completely different\\n    things. And that\\'s so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client\\n    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate\\n    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but\\n    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to\\n    end. It\\'s like an internal data team basically.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants\\n    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens\\n    that they don\\'t chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me\\n    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just\\n    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,\\n    that I can offer – and that\\'s why it\\'s hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.\\n  sec: 953\\n  time: \\'15:53\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, exactly. It\\'s more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something\\n    like that, you really need to understand who you\\'re targeting and then adjust\\n    the messaging for them. Because if it\\'s too broad, people don\\'t feel that they\\n    are being addressed.\\n  sec: 957\\n  time: \\'15:57\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: You\\'re still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer\\n    brands?\\n  sec: 975\\n  time: \\'16:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I try to, because that\\'s where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.\\n    Yeah.\\n  sec: 981\\n  time: \\'16:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career\\n- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty\\n    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least\\n    you didn\\'t tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you\\n    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data\\n    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.\\n    I don’t know, you didn\\'t work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or\\n    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it\\'s like everything. Also,\\n    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That\\'s a lot. Maybe the question I have\\n    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested\\n    in so many areas?\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist\\n    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want\\n    to have in my deep learning model. I\\'m not excited about that. You immediately\\n    see on my face, I\\'m like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting\\n    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data\\n    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing\\n    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole\\n    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those\\n    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,\\n    yes and some of the stuff, no.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then it also starts to be – I\\'m not a profile for corporate companies, for\\n    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over\\n    the time – I\\'m not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I\\'m not the best fit.\\n    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don\\'t want to do\\n    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,\\n    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them\\n    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics\\n    or go to the tech team and speak their language.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s so funny, because bioinformatics, it\\'s a bridge between informaticians\\n    and biologists because those two don\\'t know how to communicate with each other.\\n    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but\\n    doesn\\'t know anything in depth. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?\\n    Or do you think it\\'s fine?\\n  sec: 1176\\n  time: \\'19:36\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: If you\\'re a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep\\n    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you\\'re internally\\n    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you\\n    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the\\n    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy\\n    right now.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction\\n    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let\\'s say, from Shopify and packs the raw data\\n    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase\\n    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to\\n    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client\\n    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I\\'m like, “Yes.” I\\'m\\n    just super happy about this. Once you\\'re happy, you\\'re going this extra mile,\\n    and you\\'re enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Connecting business and data\\n- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least\\n    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed\\n    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.\\n    That\\'s correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?\\n  sec: 1282\\n  time: \\'21:22\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, right now I\\'m focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.\\n    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and\\n    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and\\n    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What\\n    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How\\n    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?\\n    But I know exactly what the steps there are.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business\\n    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,\\n    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I\\'m working with\\n    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What\\n    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”\\n    That’s easier stuff, but that\\'s what they need to know in order to understand\\n    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never\\n    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not\\n    there.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients\\n- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.\\n    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,\\n    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”\\n  sec: 1389\\n  time: \\'23:09\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three\\n    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in\\n    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I\\'\\'m addressing\\n    them. You don\\'\\'t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my\\n    audience? What\\'\\'s the type of voice I\\'\\'m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and\\n    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.\\'\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and\\n    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting\\n    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest\\n    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That\\'s where internally I had to\\n    struggle with myself. That\\'s where you also realize that might be the point when\\n    you\\'re getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who\\n    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice\\n    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?\\n    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe\\n    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.\\n  sec: 1488\\n  time: \\'24:48\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I\\'m loud. I love laughing.\\n    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional\\n    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That\\'s what I thought – I wanted\\n    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,\\n    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that\\n    I don\\'t want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying\\n    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package\\n    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone\\n    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as\\n    well, at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1584\\n  time: \\'26:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Oh, no. It\\'s super ad hoc-ey, right? It\\'s not even stupid joking. It\\'s rather\\n    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You\\n    just start to be friends with those people, right? It\\'s so funny, with all my\\n    clients, with the older teams, I\\'m in a really good relationship, and they are\\n    super happy to see me and I\\'m also super happy to see them. So you start to have\\n    those internal jokes at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1589\\n  time: \\'26:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I\\'m trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience\\n    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don\\'t seem super\\n    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four\\n    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching\\n    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different\\n    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don\\'t seem very related?\\n  sec: 1623\\n  time: \\'27:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows\\n    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind\\n    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,\\n    “Okay, she\\'s technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands\\n    me immediately.” That\\'s what I meant. It\\'s hard for me and that\\'s what I need\\n    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: At the end of the day, what do I really want to do? Fundraising is super tiresome.\\n    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to\\n    submit everything to the investor. It\\'s not this dream job. It\\'s super intense.\\n    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job\\n    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I\\'m enjoying the most where\\n    I don\\'t burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part\\n    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that\\n    I attract the right audience as well.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s work in fundraising\\n- line: But for you as a generalist, what you enjoy now might not be the same as what\\n    you enjoy tomorrow, right? How do you live with this? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1750\\n  time: \\'29:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah. Yes, exactly. That\\'s a good question. Right now, I know that fundraising\\n    is fun and that\\'s where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors\\n    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it\\'s super\\n    intense. Let\\'s put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also\\n    people – who you work with.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: All my clients are super fun, nice people. Sometimes, of course, there are\\n    some parts that I don\\'t enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I\\'m like,\\n    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.\\n    That\\'s where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.\\n    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn\\'t happen every day.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What kind of work exactly do you do for fundraising? I guess it\\'s somehow\\n    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these\\n    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look\\n    in the future.” So you\\'re still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.\\n    Right?\\n  sec: 1826\\n  time: \\'30:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active\\n    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort\\n    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there\\n    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which\\n    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird\\n    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don\\'t find it weird.”\\n    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,\\n    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,\\n    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.\\n    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.\\n    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.\\n  sec: 1845\\n  time: \\'30:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Cohorts and KPIs\\n- line: Do you have any examples of these cohorts and KPIs? Maybe it doesn\\'t have\\n    to come from a specific client, but just to understand what exactly you do.\\n  sec: 1906\\n  time: \\'31:46\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but\\n    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then\\n    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question\\n    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That\\'s where you define\\n    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those\\n    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in\\n    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you\\'re\\n    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is\\n    it the traffic that marketing\\'s attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then\\n    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just\\n    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”\\n  sec: 1915\\n  time: \\'31:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, first it\\'s about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,\\n    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what\\'s\\n    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?\\n  sec: 1991\\n  time: \\'33:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising\\n    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some\\n    of the stuff we never implemented – it\\'s only for fundraising. But yeah, it\\'s\\n    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how\\n    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?\\n  sec: 2012\\n  time: \\'33:32\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Improving communication between the data and business teams\\n- line: We spoke about fundraising to some extent, but I\\'m also curious about the\\n    other three parts, especially this coaching data and the business team aspect.\\n    How is it similar? How is it related? What do you do there?\\n  sec: 2043\\n  time: \\'34:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: This project will be… I\\'m not doing it right now, it\\'s one of the future projects.\\n    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It\\'s like six, seven years\\n    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it\\'s\\n    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.\\n    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain\\n    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.\\n    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they\\n    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need\\n    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.\\n    And then they don\\'t understand just what the business team needs because they\\n    don\\'t have time to understand the business.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Those people are not business savvy. That\\'s the thing, you have engineers\\n    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are\\n    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that\\'s where I try to help.\\n    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,\\n    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties\\n    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it\\'s already a success at the\\n    end of the day. It\\'s also hard for me to measure the success because what I do\\n    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you\\n    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes\\n    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So you kind of act as a translator – you translate from one language to another.\\n    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between\\n    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,\\n    and you help somebody else achieve the same.\\n  sec: 2170\\n  time: \\'36:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. That\\'s exactly what I was doing with bioinformatics as well – helping\\n    those informaticians and  biologists actually to make sure that this whole thing\\n    works together.\\n  sec: 2189\\n  time: \\'36:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Motivating every link in the company’s chain\\n- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being\\n    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you\\'ve done\\n    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if\\n    you don\\'t do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would\\n    approach this. So that\\'s one thing, I think, that can help you in your current\\n    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?\\n  sec: 2203\\n  time: \\'36:43\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That\\'s so funny, people\\n    know that I know best practices. but I don\\'t know… I know what doesn\\'t work for\\n    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the\\n    patterns, and you\\'re like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we\\'ll\\n    struggle with that. So let\\'s not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn\\'t work\\n    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let\\'s call\\n    them “disasters,” in the future.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Also, it\\'s all about the people\\'s communication. You just adjust to how people\\n    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That\\'s why, with\\n    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with\\n    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to\\n    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches\\n    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every\\n    person, basically.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: The cons of freelancing\\n- line: Are there any cons of freelancing? Are there any cons of being a generalist\\n    when freelancing right now?\\n  sec: 2325\\n  time: \\'38:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what\\n    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation\\n    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also\\n    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood\\n    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn\\'t work that way.\\n  sec: 2336\\n  time: \\'38:56\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That’s too bad. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2366\\n  time: \\'39:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. [chuckle] So I think it\\'s hard for me to sell this generalistic thing\\n    because there are lots of other agencies or freelancers who have a very specialized\\n    focus and then people ask me, “What is the difference between you and them?\\n  sec: 2367\\n  time: \\'39:27\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is a data agency?\\n  sec: 2390\\n  time: \\'39:50\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands\\n    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may\\n    also might help a bit with the tracking. I\\'m kind of competing with them, but\\n    on the other hand, I\\'m not. Because I\\'m not going against the typical data engineer\\n    – I\\'m more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things\\n    out and then implement.\\n  sec: 2393\\n  time: \\'39:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they\\n    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,\\n    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I\\n    don\\'t know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?\\n  sec: 2429\\n  time: \\'40:29\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, that\\'s the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies\\n    don\\'t sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell\\n    dashboards. And that\\'s what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?\\n    What is in the back? They\\'re like, “I don\\'t care. I just want this fancy dashboard\\n    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured\\n    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level\\n    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech\\n    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how\\n    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That\\'s the thing, again, adjusting the\\n    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2447\\n  time: \\'40:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So how do you compete with them? By making selfies? [Jekaterina laughs] Posting\\n    selfies on LinkedIn? Because I don\\'t think they do this, right? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2504\\n  time: \\'41:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I\\'m more on the business side. I\\n    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at\\n    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which\\n    is experience that those agencies don\\'t have – operationally being involved in\\n    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).\\n    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,\\n    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that\\'s where I get\\n    involved immediately.\\n  sec: 2512\\n  time: \\'41:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Balancing projects and networking\\n- line: Okay. We have a few more questions. A question from Claire, “What are the\\n    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”\\n  sec: 2560\\n  time: \\'42:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don\\'t be confused by this “free”\\n    prefix in “freelancing”. You\\'re free in terms of choosing who you work with and\\n    when you work, but that doesn\\'t mean that you will now surf for a week and then\\n    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn\\'t work, because you need to work\\n    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing\\n    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them\\n    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make\\n    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s why there\\'s not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the\\n    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people\\n    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they\\n    want to solve the problem. I\\'m really intrigued by those kinds of people. The\\n    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without\\n    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that\\n    doesn\\'t mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute\\n    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.\\n    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,\\n    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you deal with this stress? By planning things?\\n  sec: 2685\\n  time: \\'44:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.\\n    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing\\n    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term\\n    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where\\n    you don\\'t know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or\\n    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don\\'t\\n    have any savings. That\\'s hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.\\n  sec: 2689\\n  time: \\'44:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Or at least if you have a client lined up for the next half a year. Right?\\n  sec: 2738\\n  time: \\'45:38\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it\\'s fine. The hardest part… if you don\\'t have clients,\\n    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You\\n    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits\\n    hard.\\n  sec: 2743\\n  time: \\'45:43\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What do you do for that? How do you deal with this?\\n  sec: 2765\\n  time: \\'46:05\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”\\n    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where\\n    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the\\n    freelancers networks? What should I do?”\\n  sec: 2769\\n  time: \\'46:09\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Like Fiverr, right? These kinds of places?\\n  sec: 2787\\n  time: \\'46:27\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of\\n    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and\\n    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2788\\n  time: \\'46:28\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That if you don\\'t, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?\\n  sec: 2805\\n  time: \\'46:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. But that\\'s the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn\\'t\\n    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,\\n    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They\\n    feel good about me.” So that\\'s when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable\\n    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started\\n    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,\\n    once I got out of my comfort zone. That\\'s the thing. Oh! One more thing that\\'s\\n    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m\\n    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation\\n    process. You come in and what I\\'m used to at Gitti, but had been working there\\n    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.\\n    With every new client, I don\\'t have this freedom. I don\\'t have this trust. So\\n    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.\\n    It takes time. That\\'s where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant\\n    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”\\n  sec: 2808\\n  time: \\'46:48\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Yeah, it does sound very hard. Do you work more now than compared to previously?\\n  sec: 2895\\n  time: \\'48:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Yes, I do work more. That\\'s the thing, chatting with people – do you\\n    consider that work or not work? Growing this audience.\\n  sec: 2903\\n  time: \\'48:23\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Networking. Yeah. Okay.\\n  sec: 2915\\n  time: \\'48:35\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- header: The importance of enjoying what you do\\n- line: That\\'s the question – you, as a person, are you happy doing that? If you\\'re\\n    happy doing that, if you enjoy having three coffee meetings during the day in\\n    different parts of the city and you\\'re running around like crazy – and you need\\n    to come to those meetings as if you\\'re fresh, energized. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2916\\n  time: \\'48:36\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you still need to do work for other clients. Right?\\n  sec: 2938\\n  time: \\'48:58\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. Again, if it makes you happy, if you have the energy for that – and\\n    you need to create this energy, energy doesn\\'t come from out of the blue – then\\n    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn\\'t matter how long you will work at the\\n    end of the day. But it\\'s also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That\\'s\\n    the thing, chatting with people – I don\\'t see that as working hours. But for those\\n    hours, currently, I\\'m not paid either.\\n  sec: 2941\\n  time: \\'49:01\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you create this energy? Where do you get it from?\\n  sec: 2971\\n  time: \\'49:31\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t know. [laughs]\\n  sec: 2974\\n  time: \\'49:34\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you just naturally come refreshed to every meeting?\\n  sec: 2981\\n  time: \\'49:41\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No, the thing is that I think before joining Gitti, I was calmer and maybe\\n    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That\\'s what I love about\\n    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I\\n    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone\\n    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it\\'s\\n    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure\\n    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don\\'t need to be sad. I don\\'t need to\\n    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.\\n    That\\'s where I am now. I\\'m super happy with what I\\'m doing again. This happiness\\n    creates the energy at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2984\\n  time: \\'49:44\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: In some ways, the secret is positive self-talk. Right?\\n  sec: 3057\\n  time: \\'50:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[chuckles] Exactly. But that\\'\\'s the thing, if you start doubting yourself,\\n    that\\'\\'s the most negative energy that you can have. It will not help further.\\'\\n  sec: 3062\\n  time: \\'51:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Growing the client base\\n- line: Sarah wrote a comment “Passion and desire to help and the impact in many trials\\n    is so fulfilling.” [Jekaterina agrees] This is a good summary. So you said that\\n    in addition to “work,” meaning helping clients, you also need to grow your client\\n    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.\\n    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from\\n    Wilhelm is, “How do you reach out for new clients? How do you grow your client\\n    base?”\\n  sec: 3076\\n  time: \\'51:16\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t do cold outreach. This is hard. This is annoying. This makes me sad\\n    – when somebody doesn\\'t answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with\\n    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack\\n    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about\\n    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,\\n    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several\\n    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed\\n    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn\\'t care about their profiles.\\n    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking\\n    helped a bit. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 3113\\n  time: \\'51:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,\\n    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that\\n    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you\\n    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And\\n    then they decide to talk to you themselves?\\n  sec: 3177\\n  time: \\'52:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I mean, the conversion rate from 250 people to 2 people is super small,\\n    I agree. But it\\'s fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible\\n    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have\\n    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that\\n    question. I\\'m also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions\\n    and I also jumped on that. I\\'m like, “Okay, let me help you.”\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: There’s one potential client – well, not even potential, but we just chatted\\n    with her – her freelancer for Google Analytics is not answering her and she has\\n    a project where she wants to move from GA3 to GA4 and adjust some stuff. So I\\n    was like, “Hey, let\\'s have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might\\n    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just\\n    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and\\n    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen\\n    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, so networking – helping and stalking people on LinkedIn. [chuckles]\\n    That\\'s your secret?\\n  sec: 3289\\n  time: \\'54:49\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] And selfies. Don’t forget selfies.\\'\\n  sec: 3295\\n  time: \\'54:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: In the office work vs working remotely\\n- line: Selfies, yeah. That\\'s the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is\\n    it always within Berlin in an office?\\n  sec: 3299\\n  time: \\'54:59\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I love being in the office. That\\'s where this whole energy is great – this\\n    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will\\n    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I\\'m trying to always do 100%. So either 100%\\n    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still\\n    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere\\n    else. I still don\\'t know.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That\\'s where the “free” comes\\n    in. If I\\'m able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for\\n    them, and I don\\'t need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.\\n    This is also amazing. That\\'s where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in\\n    “freelance” comes in.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s advice who people who feel stuck\\n- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions\\n    that we prepared. I don\\'t know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes\\n    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people\\n    who feel stuck at what they\\'re doing?\\n  sec: 3371\\n  time: \\'56:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Don\\'t sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don\\'t quit today. [chuckles] Don\\'t\\n    do that. Let\\'s say you\\'re a machine learning engineer, and you\\'re like, “I\\'m a\\n    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.\\n    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting\\n    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.\\n    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,\\n    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told\\n    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with\\n    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don\\'t sit on the\\n    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also\\n    fine.\\n  sec: 3390\\n  time: \\'56:30\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: If you feel stuck and you want to be a freelancer, this is what you should\\n    do? In general – talk to people, right?\\n  sec: 3454\\n  time: \\'57:34\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But that\\'s the thing, even if you don\\'t want to do freelancing. Just start\\n    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with\\n    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.\\n  sec: 3462\\n  time: \\'57:42\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s resource recommendations\\n- line: Is there any book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners?\\n  sec: 3483\\n  time: \\'58:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s\\n    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.\\n    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with\\n    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments\\n    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what\\n    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book. I just read it recently.\\'\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So that\\'s the general book and another one is more about marketing analytics,\\n    which is what I was doing the last few years. There\\'s this guy in Google, who’s\\n    like the Senior Director of Strategic Analytics or something – Avinash Kaushik.\\n    So his blog and newsletters. That\\'s just a bomb of knowledge. So for anyone who\\n    is interested in marketing analytics, that\\'s the newsletter to read.\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also usually ask what the best way to reach out to you is, but I think it\\'s\\n    LinkedIn. Right? [Jekaterina confirms] We’ll include the link to your profile.\\n    I think that\\'s all we have time for today. That was amazing – talking to you.\\n    You\\'re very energetic. I feel the energy now. I can go and work and something.\\n    Great! Yeah, thanks for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks\\n    for telling your story. It was amazing. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us\\n    today. Have a great rest of your day!\\n  sec: 3564\\n  time: \\'59:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Thank you so much.

You need to think\\n    about what\\'s your product. Is your product a software engineering project? Then\\n    you need software engineers at the beginning. If your project is just a consultancy,\\n    then you can hire any role.\\n  sec: 3174\\n  time: \\'52:54\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: \"A question from Kai, \\\\u201CHow do you see the role of corporate IT regarding\\\\\\n    \\\\ data science?\\\\u201D I\\'m not sure I completely understand it. Do you have an\\\\\\n    \\\\ idea what corporate IT is? So probably maybe something like in companies like\\\\\\n    \\\\ Axel Springer?\"\\n  sec: 3198\\n  time: \\'53:18\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \"In the corporate world, in a company like Axel Springer that has corporate\\\\\\n    \\\\ IT \\\\u2013 I don\\'t think an corporate IT system makes sense for a company like\\\\\\n    \\\\ Axel Springer in the future. Axel Springer is turning into a tech company. Everything\\\\\\n    \\\\ that is within the company is driven by technology. So there will not be this\\\\\\n    \\\\ central corporate IT department. And the corporate IT will be like a DevOps\\\\\\n    \\\\ role \\\\u2014 within a whole technology company. And then data science will play\\\\\\n    \\\\ a part within this technology organization. I hope this answers the question.\"\\n  sec: 3215\\n  time: \\'53:35\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: \"Another question is \\\\u201CHow do you keep a good team?

I didn\\'t have the problem of\\n    people leaving me because I was always ensuring that people are getting paid fairly.\\n    And also have interesting projects. If you are going to balance these two things\\n    out, then you can keep the people. When you start to give people shitty projects,\\n    or when you micromanage them, then they will leave you someday. Also when you\\'re\\n    not gonna pay them fairly. Then this is also a big problem. That is something\\n    that I learned over the time. This is what kept the people working for me. Very\\n    simple ingredient actually.\\n  sec: 3283\\n  time: \\'54:43\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: So, two things, pay well and give interesting projects. Dat, will you prefer\\n    a mathematician, or a computer specialist for a machine learning position?

If you\\\\u2019re a computer\\\\\\n    \\\\ scientist, you need to understand the math behind machine learning systems.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Which is not so complicated.

So, Luke, let\\'s start with your background. Can you tell\\n    us how you started your career? How you got into AI and how it led to co-founding\\n    your own recruitment company?\\n  sec: 160\\n  time: \\'2:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \"Thanks for inviting me on the show Alexey. Hi to everyone who\\'s joined. As\\\\\\n    \\\\ Alexey said, my name is Luke, and I\\'m the co-founder of Neural AI. I\\'ve been\\\\\\n    \\\\ recruiting in the data analytics space for probably close to 10 years now. That\\\\\\n    \\\\ started in the traditional BI and analytic space. Naturally, as things became\\\\\\n    \\\\ more prevalent in the industry, like advanced analytics, and data science and\\\\\\n    \\\\ machine learning and deep learning, my career transitioned with it. Most people\\\\\\n    \\\\ in recruitment \\\\u2014 99% \\\\u2014 fell into it. Then most people fall out of\\\\\\n    \\\\ love with it. But I\\'ve stuck it out for 10 years now.\"\\n  sec: 177\\n  time: \\'2:57\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Neural came around from a couple of different perspectives. One of those\\\\\\n    \\\\ perspectives was\\\\u2026 I was just about to turn 30. I had two choices that I\\\\\\n    \\\\ could have made. I could either continue working for businesses that I have\\\\\\n    \\\\ to become a part of and embrace their values and embrace their processes and\\\\\\n    \\\\ the way that they work, or\\\\u2026 I build something that represents what I believe,\\\\\\n    \\\\ what I feel about how recruitment should be done.\"\\n  sec: 223\\n  time: \\'3:43\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Naturally, I went for the second option, and that led us to found Neural.\\\\\\n    \\\\ There\\'s a general consensus about what the recruitment industry is. I really\\\\\\n    \\\\ wanted to create a business that counterbalanced the bad reputation that a lot\\\\\\n    \\\\ of recruitment consultants have. I wanted to create a business that A) is built\\\\\\n    \\\\ on the foundation of providing value to the actual community that we recruit\\\\\\n    \\\\ for, and B) try and live by something that makes deposits into that industry,\\\\\\n    \\\\ not just withdrawals. So, as Alexey said, I run a podcast and I\\'m looking into\\\\\\n    \\\\ running AI events, like seminars, to what this is. Ultimately, I wanted to create\\\\\\n    \\\\ more of a community effort rather than, \\\\u201CHey, we\\'ve got jobs, you\\'ve got\\\\\\n    \\\\ candidates,\\\\u201D or vice versa, \\\\u201CYou\\'ve got a CV, we\\'ve got some jobs.\\\\u201D\\\\\\n    \\\\ I think that\\'s very, very old school and very transactional.\"\\n  sec: 256\\n  time: \\'4:16\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"For me, as I say Neural was built on the back of wanting to create something\\\\\\n    \\\\ different that is value and community driven, rather than just, \\\\u201CHey, do\\\\\\n    \\\\ you want to work on a new business?\\\\u201D So yeah, we started in early 2020.\\\\\\n    \\\\ So probably not the best time to start a business in the bits of a global pandemic,\\\\\\n    \\\\ but the value proposition that we\\'ve got and the specialism in data, and artificial\\\\\\n    \\\\ intelligence has really hit the mark.

Indeed, what you said about the bad reputation of recruiters \\\\u2013\\\\\\n    \\\\ I think everyone can agree to that.

How do you go around that?\"\\n  sec: 388\\n  time: \\'6:28\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \"It is definitely more difficult than your average kind of development role\\\\\\n    \\\\ because \\\\u2013 you\\'ve probably experienced this as well \\\\u2014 if you speak\\\\\\n    \\\\ to 100 different people, or 100 different businesses and say, \\\\u201CWhat is\\\\\\n    \\\\ a data scientist?\\\\u201D \\\\u2013 you\\'re probably going to get 100 different answers.\\\\\\n    \\\\ One of the big challenges for us is \\\\u2013 every single position that we work\\\\\\n    \\\\ on, is quite different from the last. Every single business that we work with\\\\\\n    \\\\ has a definition of what a machine learning engineer does, or what a data scientist\\\\\\n    \\\\ does, or what X, Y and Z does.\"\\n  sec: 422\\n  time: \\'7:02\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"One of the big problems \\\\u2013 or the big challenges of the work that we\\\\\\n    \\\\ do is \\\\u2013 that every single company is different. That in itself is a challenge,\\\\\\n    \\\\ because you need to first understand the problems and the different challenges\\\\\\n    \\\\ that those individual businesses are facing and it\\'s difficult to group stuff\\\\\\n    \\\\ together when everyone\\'s got a different perspective on stuff. I can\\'t remember\\\\\\n    \\\\ the last time I worked on an easy position. Now, I don\\'t think there\\'s such\\\\\\n    \\\\ a thing in the data science and AI community, especially at the senior level.\\\\\\n    \\\\ But for me, I think our process breaks down into\\\\u2026 to just give you a real\\\\\\n    \\\\ quick bullet point for what we do.\"\\n  sec: 455\\n  time: \\'7:35\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: It breaks down into six key areas. Number one is role definition. Typically,\\n    we\\'ll work with businesses to help them define the actual conditions within the\\n    business. A lot of companies still struggle with that, because it\\'s still such\\n    a new, undefined market. We help companies define the actual positions that they\\'re\\n    looking for, and offer guidance in terms of what\\'s achievable.\\n  sec: 495\\n  time: \\'8:15\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Secondly, we are heavily network-focused in terms of the candidates that\\\\\\n    \\\\ we typically provide. As a business, we don\\'t advertise. We do a little bit,\\\\\\n    \\\\ but that\\'s not our main source of candidate attraction. For us, the second point\\\\\\n    \\\\ is we would market map the talent pools of people that they\\'re potentially looking\\\\\\n    \\\\ for \\\\u2013 both from our network and from a headhunting perspective. So essentially,\\\\\\n    \\\\ it\\'d be the people that we know and the people that we don\\'t know.\"\\n  sec: 522\\n  time: \\'8:42\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: Thirdly, we would put together a long and short list. The long list are the\\n    people that we think could be okay for the role or have quite a lot of crossover.\\n    The shortlist of the people that we spoke to, that we know are right for that\\n    position. We then deliver the CV and put it into the business.\\n  sec: 554\\n  time: \\'9:14\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: Following that we would manage that process of recruitment. You\\'ve got to\\n    think of us as your interview buddy. That\\'s probably a really bad way to describe\\n    it. But we manage the process from end-to-end, both from a client and candidate\\n    perspective. So an interview preparation feedback, we deliver that. We help you\\n    prepare. We highlight concerns or positives in the process. If there are problems\\n    or challenges, we tend to bring that to the table, and we will try and overcome\\n    them with both candidate and client.\\n  sec: 575\\n  time: \\'9:35\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Lastly, when we get to that stage, we manage the closing of the process,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both from an offer negotiation perspective, but also from resignation, and any\\\\\\n    \\\\ kind of problems that come up in the process. So, we\\'re not a traditional recruitment\\\\\\n    \\\\ company, we do everything. The clients work with us on a singular position or\\\\\\n    \\\\ two or three positions, but they\\'ll be on an exclusive basis. We will be essentially\\\\\\n    \\\\ an extension of that company that we\\'re working with.

We\\'ll discuss going from\\n    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer\\n    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building\\n    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience\\n    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,\\n    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur\\n    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It\\'s\\n    a pleasure to have you here.\\n  sec: 71\\n  time: \\'1:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,\\n    actually. I think we\\'ve known each other for some time. I\\'m really happy to be\\n    here.\\n  sec: 112\\n  time: \\'1:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s background\\n- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]\\n    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let\\'s start with\\n    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n  sec: 122\\n  time: \\'2:02\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening\\n    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s\\n    and Master\\'s degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes\\n    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the\\n    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master\\'s degree,\\n    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.\\n    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering\\n    part, which I loved, but I didn\\'t enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched\\n    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time\\n    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,\\n    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that\\'s\\n    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with\\n    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people\\n    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That\\'s where all\\n    my engineering background comes from.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That\\'s\\n    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don\\'t you start something?” and\\n    that\\'s when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there\\'s a startup\\n    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,\\n    it\\'s pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself\\n    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it\\'s kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.\\n    [chuckles] I\\'m more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find\\n    a CEO match.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for\\n    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well\\n    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch\\n    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went\\n    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It\\'s like\\n    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is compliance?\\n  sec: 300\\n  time: \\'5:00\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Basically, it\\'s KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to\\n    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?\\n    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was\\n    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,\\n    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident\\n    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,\\n    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American\\n    startup, but it didn\\'t work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really\\n    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody\\n    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”\\n    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake\\n    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something\\n    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,\\n    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we\\n    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,\\n    but I didn\\'t feel that it was for me, so I left.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.\\n    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they\\n    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it\\'s a beauty brand. There,\\n    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.\\n    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing\\n- line: That\\'s quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start\\n    telling us what you do now, it\\'s also interesting to know – how did you decide\\n    what you want to do as a freelancer?\\n  sec: 433\\n  time: \\'7:13\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What\\n    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went\\n    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,\\n    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.\\n    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late\\n    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people\\n    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to\\n    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I\\'m like, “No, I don\\'t want to be hired.\\n    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti\\n    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So\\n    I\\'m like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don\\'t know how, but I managed\\n    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing\\n    for the company. Now, it\\'s also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)\\n    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back\\n    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that\\'s how\\n    it started. They are a SaaS company. It\\'s a completely different business model\\n    than what I\\'m used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really\\n    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help\\n    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could\\n    attract. I didn\\'t even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,\\n    “Okay, let\\'s just leave and figure this out.”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what\\n    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 580\\n  time: \\'9:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated\\n    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client\\n    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I\\n    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still\\n    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.\\'\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,\\n    “I don\\'t have clients. I don\\'t have income.” I was tapping into my savings and\\n    I started panicking. Of course, I didn\\'t announce to anybody that I was freelancing.\\n    So how should anybody know about that?\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients\\n- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?\\n  sec: 644\\n  time: \\'10:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly! I didn\\'t announce it on LinkedIn. I didn\\'t tell anybody. I mean,\\n    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at\\n    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if\\n    I can\\'t make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit\\n    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I\\'m freelancing right now, but not\\n    like, “Hey, I\\'m a data freelancer. I\\'m here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series\\n    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 647\\n  time: \\'10:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for\\n    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps\\n    to get noticed, right?\\n  sec: 690\\n  time: \\'11:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it\\'s crazy how many\\n    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it\\'s\\n    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing\\n    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when\\n    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated\\n    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I\\n    think, and I got two clients out of that.\\n  sec: 701\\n  time: \\'11:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?\\n  sec: 746\\n  time: \\'12:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,\\n    but I have a closed Instagram. It\\'s a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a\\n    professional thing. I was like, “It\\'s so uncomfortable.” But that\\'s the thing,\\n    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,\\n    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then\\n    I didn\\'t care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.\\n    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you\\'re doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.\\n    Okay, then let\\'s do more selfies.” [laughs]\\n  sec: 749\\n  time: \\'12:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I still don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because\\n    it’s so awkward, at least to me.\\n  sec: 792\\n  time: \\'13:12\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let\\'s just see\\n    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.\\n  sec: 800\\n  time: \\'13:20\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer\\n    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?\\n  sec: 812\\n  time: \\'13:32\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: That\\'s funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It\\'s kind of\\n    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was\\n    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted\\n    – and that\\'s so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that\\n    it\\'s also hard for me to understand what pain point I\\'m solving exactly. So that\\n    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted\\n    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure\\n    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.\\n    So it\\'s not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for\\n    the data that they have.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s completely different. It\\'s not direct-to-consumer. It\\'s completely different\\n    things. And that\\'s so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client\\n    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate\\n    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but\\n    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to\\n    end. It\\'s like an internal data team basically.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants\\n    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens\\n    that they don\\'t chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me\\n    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just\\n    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,\\n    that I can offer – and that\\'s why it\\'s hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.\\n  sec: 953\\n  time: \\'15:53\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, exactly. It\\'s more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something\\n    like that, you really need to understand who you\\'re targeting and then adjust\\n    the messaging for them. Because if it\\'s too broad, people don\\'t feel that they\\n    are being addressed.\\n  sec: 957\\n  time: \\'15:57\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: You\\'re still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer\\n    brands?\\n  sec: 975\\n  time: \\'16:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I try to, because that\\'s where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.\\n    Yeah.\\n  sec: 981\\n  time: \\'16:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career\\n- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty\\n    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least\\n    you didn\\'t tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you\\n    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data\\n    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.\\n    I don’t know, you didn\\'t work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or\\n    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it\\'s like everything. Also,\\n    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That\\'s a lot. Maybe the question I have\\n    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested\\n    in so many areas?\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist\\n    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want\\n    to have in my deep learning model. I\\'m not excited about that. You immediately\\n    see on my face, I\\'m like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting\\n    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data\\n    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing\\n    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole\\n    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those\\n    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,\\n    yes and some of the stuff, no.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then it also starts to be – I\\'m not a profile for corporate companies, for\\n    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over\\n    the time – I\\'m not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I\\'m not the best fit.\\n    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don\\'t want to do\\n    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,\\n    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them\\n    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics\\n    or go to the tech team and speak their language.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s so funny, because bioinformatics, it\\'s a bridge between informaticians\\n    and biologists because those two don\\'t know how to communicate with each other.\\n    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but\\n    doesn\\'t know anything in depth. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?\\n    Or do you think it\\'s fine?\\n  sec: 1176\\n  time: \\'19:36\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: If you\\'re a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep\\n    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you\\'re internally\\n    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you\\n    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the\\n    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy\\n    right now.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction\\n    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let\\'s say, from Shopify and packs the raw data\\n    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase\\n    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to\\n    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client\\n    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I\\'m like, “Yes.” I\\'m\\n    just super happy about this. Once you\\'re happy, you\\'re going this extra mile,\\n    and you\\'re enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Connecting business and data\\n- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least\\n    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed\\n    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.\\n    That\\'s correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?\\n  sec: 1282\\n  time: \\'21:22\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, right now I\\'m focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.\\n    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and\\n    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and\\n    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What\\n    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How\\n    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?\\n    But I know exactly what the steps there are.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business\\n    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,\\n    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I\\'m working with\\n    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What\\n    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”\\n    That’s easier stuff, but that\\'s what they need to know in order to understand\\n    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never\\n    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not\\n    there.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients\\n- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.\\n    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,\\n    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”\\n  sec: 1389\\n  time: \\'23:09\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three\\n    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in\\n    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I\\'\\'m addressing\\n    them. You don\\'\\'t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my\\n    audience? What\\'\\'s the type of voice I\\'\\'m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and\\n    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.\\'\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and\\n    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting\\n    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest\\n    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That\\'s where internally I had to\\n    struggle with myself. That\\'s where you also realize that might be the point when\\n    you\\'re getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who\\n    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice\\n    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?\\n    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe\\n    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.\\n  sec: 1488\\n  time: \\'24:48\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I\\'m loud. I love laughing.\\n    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional\\n    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That\\'s what I thought – I wanted\\n    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,\\n    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that\\n    I don\\'t want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying\\n    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package\\n    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone\\n    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as\\n    well, at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1584\\n  time: \\'26:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Oh, no. It\\'s super ad hoc-ey, right? It\\'s not even stupid joking. It\\'s rather\\n    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You\\n    just start to be friends with those people, right? It\\'s so funny, with all my\\n    clients, with the older teams, I\\'m in a really good relationship, and they are\\n    super happy to see me and I\\'m also super happy to see them. So you start to have\\n    those internal jokes at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1589\\n  time: \\'26:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I\\'m trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience\\n    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don\\'t seem super\\n    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four\\n    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching\\n    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different\\n    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don\\'t seem very related?\\n  sec: 1623\\n  time: \\'27:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows\\n    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind\\n    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,\\n    “Okay, she\\'s technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands\\n    me immediately.” That\\'s what I meant. It\\'s hard for me and that\\'s what I need\\n    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: At the end of the day, what do I really want to do? Fundraising is super tiresome.\\n    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to\\n    submit everything to the investor. It\\'s not this dream job. It\\'s super intense.\\n    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job\\n    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I\\'m enjoying the most where\\n    I don\\'t burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part\\n    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that\\n    I attract the right audience as well.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s work in fundraising\\n- line: But for you as a generalist, what you enjoy now might not be the same as what\\n    you enjoy tomorrow, right? How do you live with this? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1750\\n  time: \\'29:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah. Yes, exactly. That\\'s a good question. Right now, I know that fundraising\\n    is fun and that\\'s where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors\\n    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it\\'s super\\n    intense. Let\\'s put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also\\n    people – who you work with.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: All my clients are super fun, nice people. Sometimes, of course, there are\\n    some parts that I don\\'t enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I\\'m like,\\n    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.\\n    That\\'s where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.\\n    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn\\'t happen every day.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What kind of work exactly do you do for fundraising? I guess it\\'s somehow\\n    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these\\n    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look\\n    in the future.” So you\\'re still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.\\n    Right?\\n  sec: 1826\\n  time: \\'30:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active\\n    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort\\n    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there\\n    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which\\n    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird\\n    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don\\'t find it weird.”\\n    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,\\n    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,\\n    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.\\n    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.\\n    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.\\n  sec: 1845\\n  time: \\'30:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Cohorts and KPIs\\n- line: Do you have any examples of these cohorts and KPIs? Maybe it doesn\\'t have\\n    to come from a specific client, but just to understand what exactly you do.\\n  sec: 1906\\n  time: \\'31:46\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but\\n    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then\\n    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question\\n    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That\\'s where you define\\n    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those\\n    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in\\n    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you\\'re\\n    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is\\n    it the traffic that marketing\\'s attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then\\n    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just\\n    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”\\n  sec: 1915\\n  time: \\'31:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, first it\\'s about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,\\n    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what\\'s\\n    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?\\n  sec: 1991\\n  time: \\'33:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising\\n    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some\\n    of the stuff we never implemented – it\\'s only for fundraising. But yeah, it\\'s\\n    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how\\n    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?\\n  sec: 2012\\n  time: \\'33:32\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Improving communication between the data and business teams\\n- line: We spoke about fundraising to some extent, but I\\'m also curious about the\\n    other three parts, especially this coaching data and the business team aspect.\\n    How is it similar? How is it related? What do you do there?\\n  sec: 2043\\n  time: \\'34:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: This project will be… I\\'m not doing it right now, it\\'s one of the future projects.\\n    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It\\'s like six, seven years\\n    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it\\'s\\n    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.\\n    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain\\n    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.\\n    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they\\n    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need\\n    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.\\n    And then they don\\'t understand just what the business team needs because they\\n    don\\'t have time to understand the business.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Those people are not business savvy. That\\'s the thing, you have engineers\\n    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are\\n    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that\\'s where I try to help.\\n    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,\\n    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties\\n    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it\\'s already a success at the\\n    end of the day. It\\'s also hard for me to measure the success because what I do\\n    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you\\n    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes\\n    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So you kind of act as a translator – you translate from one language to another.\\n    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between\\n    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,\\n    and you help somebody else achieve the same.\\n  sec: 2170\\n  time: \\'36:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. That\\'s exactly what I was doing with bioinformatics as well – helping\\n    those informaticians and  biologists actually to make sure that this whole thing\\n    works together.\\n  sec: 2189\\n  time: \\'36:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Motivating every link in the company’s chain\\n- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being\\n    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you\\'ve done\\n    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if\\n    you don\\'t do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would\\n    approach this. So that\\'s one thing, I think, that can help you in your current\\n    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?\\n  sec: 2203\\n  time: \\'36:43\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That\\'s so funny, people\\n    know that I know best practices. but I don\\'t know… I know what doesn\\'t work for\\n    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the\\n    patterns, and you\\'re like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we\\'ll\\n    struggle with that. So let\\'s not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn\\'t work\\n    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let\\'s call\\n    them “disasters,” in the future.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Also, it\\'s all about the people\\'s communication. You just adjust to how people\\n    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That\\'s why, with\\n    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with\\n    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to\\n    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches\\n    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every\\n    person, basically.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: The cons of freelancing\\n- line: Are there any cons of freelancing? Are there any cons of being a generalist\\n    when freelancing right now?\\n  sec: 2325\\n  time: \\'38:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what\\n    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation\\n    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also\\n    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood\\n    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn\\'t work that way.\\n  sec: 2336\\n  time: \\'38:56\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That’s too bad. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2366\\n  time: \\'39:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. [chuckle] So I think it\\'s hard for me to sell this generalistic thing\\n    because there are lots of other agencies or freelancers who have a very specialized\\n    focus and then people ask me, “What is the difference between you and them?\\n  sec: 2367\\n  time: \\'39:27\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is a data agency?\\n  sec: 2390\\n  time: \\'39:50\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands\\n    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may\\n    also might help a bit with the tracking. I\\'m kind of competing with them, but\\n    on the other hand, I\\'m not. Because I\\'m not going against the typical data engineer\\n    – I\\'m more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things\\n    out and then implement.\\n  sec: 2393\\n  time: \\'39:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they\\n    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,\\n    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I\\n    don\\'t know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?\\n  sec: 2429\\n  time: \\'40:29\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, that\\'s the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies\\n    don\\'t sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell\\n    dashboards. And that\\'s what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?\\n    What is in the back? They\\'re like, “I don\\'t care. I just want this fancy dashboard\\n    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured\\n    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level\\n    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech\\n    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how\\n    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That\\'s the thing, again, adjusting the\\n    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2447\\n  time: \\'40:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So how do you compete with them? By making selfies? [Jekaterina laughs] Posting\\n    selfies on LinkedIn? Because I don\\'t think they do this, right? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2504\\n  time: \\'41:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I\\'m more on the business side. I\\n    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at\\n    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which\\n    is experience that those agencies don\\'t have – operationally being involved in\\n    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).\\n    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,\\n    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that\\'s where I get\\n    involved immediately.\\n  sec: 2512\\n  time: \\'41:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Balancing projects and networking\\n- line: Okay. We have a few more questions. A question from Claire, “What are the\\n    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”\\n  sec: 2560\\n  time: \\'42:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don\\'t be confused by this “free”\\n    prefix in “freelancing”. You\\'re free in terms of choosing who you work with and\\n    when you work, but that doesn\\'t mean that you will now surf for a week and then\\n    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn\\'t work, because you need to work\\n    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing\\n    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them\\n    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make\\n    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s why there\\'s not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the\\n    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people\\n    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they\\n    want to solve the problem. I\\'m really intrigued by those kinds of people. The\\n    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without\\n    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that\\n    doesn\\'t mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute\\n    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.\\n    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,\\n    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you deal with this stress? By planning things?\\n  sec: 2685\\n  time: \\'44:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.\\n    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing\\n    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term\\n    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where\\n    you don\\'t know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or\\n    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don\\'t\\n    have any savings. That\\'s hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.\\n  sec: 2689\\n  time: \\'44:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Or at least if you have a client lined up for the next half a year. Right?\\n  sec: 2738\\n  time: \\'45:38\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it\\'s fine. The hardest part… if you don\\'t have clients,\\n    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You\\n    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits\\n    hard.\\n  sec: 2743\\n  time: \\'45:43\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What do you do for that? How do you deal with this?\\n  sec: 2765\\n  time: \\'46:05\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”\\n    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where\\n    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the\\n    freelancers networks? What should I do?”\\n  sec: 2769\\n  time: \\'46:09\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Like Fiverr, right? These kinds of places?\\n  sec: 2787\\n  time: \\'46:27\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of\\n    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and\\n    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2788\\n  time: \\'46:28\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That if you don\\'t, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?\\n  sec: 2805\\n  time: \\'46:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. But that\\'s the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn\\'t\\n    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,\\n    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They\\n    feel good about me.” So that\\'s when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable\\n    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started\\n    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,\\n    once I got out of my comfort zone. That\\'s the thing. Oh! One more thing that\\'s\\n    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m\\n    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation\\n    process. You come in and what I\\'m used to at Gitti, but had been working there\\n    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.\\n    With every new client, I don\\'t have this freedom. I don\\'t have this trust. So\\n    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.\\n    It takes time. That\\'s where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant\\n    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”\\n  sec: 2808\\n  time: \\'46:48\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Yeah, it does sound very hard. Do you work more now than compared to previously?\\n  sec: 2895\\n  time: \\'48:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Yes, I do work more. That\\'s the thing, chatting with people – do you\\n    consider that work or not work? Growing this audience.\\n  sec: 2903\\n  time: \\'48:23\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Networking. Yeah. Okay.\\n  sec: 2915\\n  time: \\'48:35\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- header: The importance of enjoying what you do\\n- line: That\\'s the question – you, as a person, are you happy doing that? If you\\'re\\n    happy doing that, if you enjoy having three coffee meetings during the day in\\n    different parts of the city and you\\'re running around like crazy – and you need\\n    to come to those meetings as if you\\'re fresh, energized. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2916\\n  time: \\'48:36\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you still need to do work for other clients. Right?\\n  sec: 2938\\n  time: \\'48:58\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. Again, if it makes you happy, if you have the energy for that – and\\n    you need to create this energy, energy doesn\\'t come from out of the blue – then\\n    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn\\'t matter how long you will work at the\\n    end of the day. But it\\'s also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That\\'s\\n    the thing, chatting with people – I don\\'t see that as working hours. But for those\\n    hours, currently, I\\'m not paid either.\\n  sec: 2941\\n  time: \\'49:01\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you create this energy? Where do you get it from?\\n  sec: 2971\\n  time: \\'49:31\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t know. [laughs]\\n  sec: 2974\\n  time: \\'49:34\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you just naturally come refreshed to every meeting?\\n  sec: 2981\\n  time: \\'49:41\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No, the thing is that I think before joining Gitti, I was calmer and maybe\\n    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That\\'s what I love about\\n    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I\\n    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone\\n    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it\\'s\\n    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure\\n    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don\\'t need to be sad. I don\\'t need to\\n    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.\\n    That\\'s where I am now. I\\'m super happy with what I\\'m doing again. This happiness\\n    creates the energy at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2984\\n  time: \\'49:44\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: In some ways, the secret is positive self-talk. Right?\\n  sec: 3057\\n  time: \\'50:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[chuckles] Exactly. But that\\'\\'s the thing, if you start doubting yourself,\\n    that\\'\\'s the most negative energy that you can have. It will not help further.\\'\\n  sec: 3062\\n  time: \\'51:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Growing the client base\\n- line: Sarah wrote a comment “Passion and desire to help and the impact in many trials\\n    is so fulfilling.” [Jekaterina agrees] This is a good summary. So you said that\\n    in addition to “work,” meaning helping clients, you also need to grow your client\\n    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.\\n    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from\\n    Wilhelm is, “How do you reach out for new clients? How do you grow your client\\n    base?”\\n  sec: 3076\\n  time: \\'51:16\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t do cold outreach. This is hard. This is annoying. This makes me sad\\n    – when somebody doesn\\'t answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with\\n    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack\\n    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about\\n    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,\\n    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several\\n    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed\\n    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn\\'t care about their profiles.\\n    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking\\n    helped a bit. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 3113\\n  time: \\'51:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,\\n    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that\\n    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you\\n    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And\\n    then they decide to talk to you themselves?\\n  sec: 3177\\n  time: \\'52:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I mean, the conversion rate from 250 people to 2 people is super small,\\n    I agree. But it\\'s fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible\\n    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have\\n    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that\\n    question. I\\'m also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions\\n    and I also jumped on that. I\\'m like, “Okay, let me help you.”\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: There’s one potential client – well, not even potential, but we just chatted\\n    with her – her freelancer for Google Analytics is not answering her and she has\\n    a project where she wants to move from GA3 to GA4 and adjust some stuff. So I\\n    was like, “Hey, let\\'s have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might\\n    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just\\n    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and\\n    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen\\n    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, so networking – helping and stalking people on LinkedIn. [chuckles]\\n    That\\'s your secret?\\n  sec: 3289\\n  time: \\'54:49\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] And selfies. Don’t forget selfies.\\'\\n  sec: 3295\\n  time: \\'54:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: In the office work vs working remotely\\n- line: Selfies, yeah. That\\'s the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is\\n    it always within Berlin in an office?\\n  sec: 3299\\n  time: \\'54:59\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I love being in the office. That\\'s where this whole energy is great – this\\n    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will\\n    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I\\'m trying to always do 100%. So either 100%\\n    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still\\n    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere\\n    else. I still don\\'t know.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That\\'s where the “free” comes\\n    in. If I\\'m able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for\\n    them, and I don\\'t need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.\\n    This is also amazing. That\\'s where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in\\n    “freelance” comes in.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s advice who people who feel stuck\\n- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions\\n    that we prepared. I don\\'t know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes\\n    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people\\n    who feel stuck at what they\\'re doing?\\n  sec: 3371\\n  time: \\'56:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Don\\'t sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don\\'t quit today. [chuckles] Don\\'t\\n    do that. Let\\'s say you\\'re a machine learning engineer, and you\\'re like, “I\\'m a\\n    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.\\n    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting\\n    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.\\n    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,\\n    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told\\n    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with\\n    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don\\'t sit on the\\n    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also\\n    fine.\\n  sec: 3390\\n  time: \\'56:30\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: If you feel stuck and you want to be a freelancer, this is what you should\\n    do? In general – talk to people, right?\\n  sec: 3454\\n  time: \\'57:34\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But that\\'s the thing, even if you don\\'t want to do freelancing. Just start\\n    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with\\n    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.\\n  sec: 3462\\n  time: \\'57:42\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s resource recommendations\\n- line: Is there any book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners?\\n  sec: 3483\\n  time: \\'58:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s\\n    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.\\n    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with\\n    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments\\n    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what\\n    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book. I just read it recently.\\'\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So that\\'s the general book and another one is more about marketing analytics,\\n    which is what I was doing the last few years. There\\'s this guy in Google, who’s\\n    like the Senior Director of Strategic Analytics or something – Avinash Kaushik.\\n    So his blog and newsletters. That\\'s just a bomb of knowledge. So for anyone who\\n    is interested in marketing analytics, that\\'s the newsletter to read.\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also usually ask what the best way to reach out to you is, but I think it\\'s\\n    LinkedIn. Right? [Jekaterina confirms] We’ll include the link to your profile.\\n    I think that\\'s all we have time for today. That was amazing – talking to you.\\n    You\\'re very energetic. I feel the energy now. I can go and work and something.\\n    Great! Yeah, thanks for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks\\n    for telling your story. It was amazing. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us\\n    today. Have a great rest of your day!\\n  sec: 3564\\n  time: \\'59:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Thank you so much.

Dat needs no introduction.\\n    If you have a LinkedIn account, you probably already know him. If you don\\'t have\\n    a LinkedIn account, Dat has a lot of experience in building data teams, and this\\n    will be the topic today. So he led a team at Idealo. This is a popular price comparison\\n    tool in Germany. Then he was a head of AI at Axel Springer. This is a big publication\\n    house. And now he is the CTO and co-founder of Priceloop. So thank you Dat for\\n    coming to the show today.\\n  sec: 126\\n  time: \\'2:06\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, thanks for having me, Alexey\\n  sec: 173\\n  time: \\'2:53\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- header: \"Dat\\\\u2019s early career\"\\n- line: Yes, we\\'ll start with your background. So can you please tell us how you started\\n    your career? How did you get into machine learning? And how this all led to becoming\\n    a CTO of your own startup?\\n  sec: 177\\n  time: \\'2:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \"Yes, sure. I would say, my career is not very straightforward. I didn\\'t study\\\\\\n    \\\\ computer science which would probably naturally grow into the area of machine\\\\\\n    \\\\ learning. I actually studied business \\\\u2014 I studied economics at Humboldt\\\\\\n    \\\\ University and I was more into investment banking.\"\\n  sec: 192\\n  time: \\'3:12\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: But since I was a child, I was a lot into gaming, and due to gaming, I also\\n    got into coding. I started to do coding very early. I think I was 12 or 13, I\\'d\\n    create my first HTML websites. I did my own forum and other stuff, and then over\\n    the time, I got into more of these areas and then I learned to program as well.\\n  sec: 222\\n  time: \\'3:42\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: \"While I was in investment banking, I solved a lot of problems with coding\\\\\\n    \\\\ and programming. It\\'s like monkey business: you have to copy paste, you sit\\\\\\n    \\\\ into 2 or 3am. And you copy and paste things. Where I just wrote a simple VBA\\\\\\n    \\\\ script on Excel, which solved my problem within two minutes where my peers were\\\\\\n    \\\\ working for three to four hours. And I was thinking, \\\\u201COkay, maybe I should\\\\\\n    \\\\ do something with software engineering,\\\\u201D\"\\n  sec: 263\\n  time: \\'4:23\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: \"It was well paid, but it\\'s really a monkey business. Then I went back to\\\\\\n    \\\\ my graduate studies I majored in, in operation research and econometrics. Then\\\\\\n    \\\\ a friend of mine, he was studying statistics in Munich. And he told me, \\\\u201C\\\\\\n    Hey, well, there\\\\u2019s this cool course \\\\u2013 machine learning. You should do\\\\\\n    \\\\ it\\\\u201D. I think a lot of people did that course at that time.\"\\n  sec: 297\\n  time: \\'4:57\\'\\n  who: Dat\\n- line: \"I think it was six years ago, something \\\\u2013 six or seven years ago, I\\\\\\n    \\\\ did that course that was like, \\\\u201COh, yeah, that sounds interesting what\\\\\\n    \\\\ he\\'s doing.\\\\u201D And a lot of the stuff that he said in the course, is something\\\\\\n    \\\\ that I already did at university, but it was presented differently.

How you got into AI and how it led to co-founding\\n    your own recruitment company?\\n  sec: 160\\n  time: \\'2:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \"Thanks for inviting me on the show Alexey. Hi to everyone who\\'s joined. As\\\\\\n    \\\\ Alexey said, my name is Luke, and I\\'m the co-founder of Neural AI. I\\'ve been\\\\\\n    \\\\ recruiting in the data analytics space for probably close to 10 years now. That\\\\\\n    \\\\ started in the traditional BI and analytic space. Naturally, as things became\\\\\\n    \\\\ more prevalent in the industry, like advanced analytics, and data science and\\\\\\n    \\\\ machine learning and deep learning, my career transitioned with it. Most people\\\\\\n    \\\\ in recruitment \\\\u2014 99% \\\\u2014 fell into it. Then most people fall out of\\\\\\n    \\\\ love with it. But I\\'ve stuck it out for 10 years now.\"\\n  sec: 177\\n  time: \\'2:57\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Neural came around from a couple of different perspectives.

I could either continue working for businesses that I have\\\\\\n    \\\\ to become a part of and embrace their values and embrace their processes and\\\\\\n    \\\\ the way that they work, or\\\\u2026 I build something that represents what I believe,\\\\\\n    \\\\ what I feel about how recruitment should be done.\"\\n  sec: 223\\n  time: \\'3:43\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Naturally, I went for the second option, and that led us to found Neural.\\\\\\n    \\\\ There\\'s a general consensus about what the recruitment industry is. I really\\\\\\n    \\\\ wanted to create a business that counterbalanced the bad reputation that a lot\\\\\\n    \\\\ of recruitment consultants have. I wanted to create a business that A) is built\\\\\\n    \\\\ on the foundation of providing value to the actual community that we recruit\\\\\\n    \\\\ for, and B) try and live by something that makes deposits into that industry,\\\\\\n    \\\\ not just withdrawals. So, as Alexey said, I run a podcast and I\\'m looking into\\\\\\n    \\\\ running AI events, like seminars, to what this is. Ultimately, I wanted to create\\\\\\n    \\\\ more of a community effort rather than, \\\\u201CHey, we\\'ve got jobs, you\\'ve got\\\\\\n    \\\\ candidates,\\\\u201D or vice versa, \\\\u201CYou\\'ve got a CV, we\\'ve got some jobs.\\\\u201D\\\\\\n    \\\\ I think that\\'s very, very old school and very transactional.\"\\n  sec: 256\\n  time: \\'4:16\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"For me, as I say Neural was built on the back of wanting to create something\\\\\\n    \\\\ different that is value and community driven, rather than just, \\\\u201CHey, do\\\\\\n    \\\\ you want to work on a new business?\\\\u201D So yeah, we started in early 2020.\\\\\\n    \\\\ So probably not the best time to start a business in the bits of a global pandemic,\\\\\\n    \\\\ but the value proposition that we\\'ve got and the specialism in data, and artificial\\\\\\n    \\\\ intelligence has really hit the mark.

Every single business that we work with\\\\\\n    \\\\ has a definition of what a machine learning engineer does, or what a data scientist\\\\\\n    \\\\ does, or what X, Y and Z does.\"\\n  sec: 422\\n  time: \\'7:02\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"One of the big problems \\\\u2013 or the big challenges of the work that we\\\\\\n    \\\\ do is \\\\u2013 that every single company is different. That in itself is a challenge,\\\\\\n    \\\\ because you need to first understand the problems and the different challenges\\\\\\n    \\\\ that those individual businesses are facing and it\\'s difficult to group stuff\\\\\\n    \\\\ together when everyone\\'s got a different perspective on stuff. I can\\'t remember\\\\\\n    \\\\ the last time I worked on an easy position. Now, I don\\'t think there\\'s such\\\\\\n    \\\\ a thing in the data science and AI community, especially at the senior level.\\\\\\n    \\\\ But for me, I think our process breaks down into\\\\u2026 to just give you a real\\\\\\n    \\\\ quick bullet point for what we do.\"\\n  sec: 455\\n  time: \\'7:35\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: It breaks down into six key areas. Number one is role definition. Typically,\\n    we\\'ll work with businesses to help them define the actual conditions within the\\n    business. A lot of companies still struggle with that, because it\\'s still such\\n    a new, undefined market. We help companies define the actual positions that they\\'re\\n    looking for, and offer guidance in terms of what\\'s achievable.\\n  sec: 495\\n  time: \\'8:15\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Secondly, we are heavily network-focused in terms of the candidates that\\\\\\n    \\\\ we typically provide. As a business, we don\\'t advertise. We do a little bit,\\\\\\n    \\\\ but that\\'s not our main source of candidate attraction. For us, the second point\\\\\\n    \\\\ is we would market map the talent pools of people that they\\'re potentially looking\\\\\\n    \\\\ for \\\\u2013 both from our network and from a headhunting perspective. So essentially,\\\\\\n    \\\\ it\\'d be the people that we know and the people that we don\\'t know.\"\\n  sec: 522\\n  time: \\'8:42\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: Thirdly, we would put together a long and short list. The long list are the\\n    people that we think could be okay for the role or have quite a lot of crossover.\\n    The shortlist of the people that we spoke to, that we know are right for that\\n    position. We then deliver the CV and put it into the business.\\n  sec: 554\\n  time: \\'9:14\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: Following that we would manage that process of recruitment. You\\'ve got to\\n    think of us as your interview buddy. That\\'s probably a really bad way to describe\\n    it. But we manage the process from end-to-end, both from a client and candidate\\n    perspective. So an interview preparation feedback, we deliver that. We help you\\n    prepare. We highlight concerns or positives in the process. If there are problems\\n    or challenges, we tend to bring that to the table, and we will try and overcome\\n    them with both candidate and client.\\n  sec: 575\\n  time: \\'9:35\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Lastly, when we get to that stage, we manage the closing of the process,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both from an offer negotiation perspective, but also from resignation, and any\\\\\\n    \\\\ kind of problems that come up in the process. So, we\\'re not a traditional recruitment\\\\\\n    \\\\ company, we do everything. The clients work with us on a singular position or\\\\\\n    \\\\ two or three positions, but they\\'ll be on an exclusive basis. We will be essentially\\\\\\n    \\\\ an extension of that company that we\\'re working with. And that means we run\\\\\\n    \\\\ the process in full \\\\u2013 from end to end.\"\\n  sec: 611\\n  time: \\'10:11\\'\\n  who: Luke\\n- line: \"Usually, how many candidates do you speak with?

So it’s “How do we get companies excited about using AI, even if they don't want to use our particular product? How do we get people…” You know, thinking about the art of the possible. “How can we stir the creative juices and get them thinking about ‘What could they do this year with AI?’” For some people, I joke and say, I'm the “AI missionary”.

Because for people that are traditionally marketing, they might not have the technical background to get the messaging right, so a lot of times I'm reviewing blog content, and some of the messaging stuff. For me that's a lot of fun, because it feels like it's a tough challenge. If you and I are competing on writing a blog article about AI (or anyone listening) if we're competing together, how can you – and this all goes back to speaking – how can you create content that changes an audience or moves them emotionally? The criticism I'll throw out to end this rant is – the common criticism, is that people fall into the rational mindset and that's the features and speeds. So it’s “I want you to like my product, because it has one more feature than the competition,” or “I want you to buy my hardware because it's a little faster than NVidia or Intel.” That's a very weak argument. Because humans like to make emotional decisions and then they like to confirm their emotional decisions with rational insights. The reverse doesn't really work.

The IO psychologists, they're the ones that develop hiring assessments – you're gonna go fill out this assessment to go work at the bank or something and they want to flesh out your personality traits and map that to potential performance in the future. I love being in the middle. When you're in the middle, you can understand both sides. You suddenly have a very useful perspective. If you're just in marketing, you're not going to appreciate engineering, and you're not going to even understand how to communicate it. If you're just in engineering, you're going to fall prey to the rational mindset and a lot of factoids that don't matter emotionally – they don't move the needle.

I had a math minor and at one point in my life, I thought I wanted to be a mathematician. I was so obsessed about some of this math regarding controllers. This math is pretty intense – it's state space, linear algebra. I remember giving a talk about some breakthrough on a certain type of controller for state tracking – and the math was intense. Imagine me sitting you down to walk you through an hour of math. You and I are technical, but even today, it'd be like, “I'll pass.

I just thought, “Oh my gosh, I can't believe this individual is missing out on this good content I'm sharing.” But today I would say “Yeah, I gave a terrible talk. I didn't understand my audience and it was awful.” Today I care a lot about the audience feedback, because it's a point of reference. “Did you give a good talk?” “Could you have given a better talk?” You need to consult with the audience after the talk, to find out. You're not going to make everyone happy. You're always gonna have some people — no matter how good of a speaker you are —  you're always gonna have some people that didn't like the talk or they've got some criticism. The challenge that I fall into is – I've been criticized for giving talks that are too technical.

Is this a storytelling festival? It's supposed to be a tech conference.” You need both. It's really important to decide what is the gift that you will give to the audience? That probably sounds arrogant to say. You need to give the audience something for free – some learned insight, some key points. If they never see you again, they need to be able to leave and say, “Thank you. That is useful for me.” You need to identify what that is. Identify the warm up, identify what the key takeaways that they can have. It's hard because there can't be a lot of them. I can't have 10 key takeaways – people don't remember. The other thing for talk is — they need to remember it. If I give a talk, and everyone says, “Oh, that was a great talk.” And they wake up the next morning, “Oh, I forgot what the talk was about.” It wasn't a great talk – that was a terrible talk.

There's “The Hero with 10,000 Faces.” There's a book called “Play Bigger”, it talks about category creation, which is very useful. I love “The Lean Startup” by Eric Reese. It's not to make you a better speaker, but I love the mindset of failing before you start. Can you fail on a talk before you start? If I have a talk, before I invest time and energy into doing it… or research, if I've got a research idea for a talk, can I just fail today? Before I even start, can I fail? I love the idea of failing today and saving all that time rather than committing to something… and something you can start today. I do love the idea, if you've got kids – start telling them stories today. These aren't stories you're reading, you're winging it. Tell them a story from your childhood, something stupid you did, something funny, exciting, sad. Tell them a story and practice that. You become a better storyteller. The evidence of success is if your kids begin to ask for another story and another story after the second one. You can really level up. And practice maintaining their attention. Kids have short attention spans – this is a good practice. You know if you have their attention, so practice maintaining their attention. If you get better at this, you will be a better speaker.\",\n",

A big part of being a good speaker is having good emotional intelligence and being able to read your audience. If your audience is checking out, if the energy is going down, you have to fix it – as a speaker. As a speaker, you're not scripted. You can do all sorts of things to fix that attention. Sometimes it's hard, it takes a lot of energy and sometimes you screw it up. It’s just like a comedian – some comedians, they're really funny and sometimes they have off nights and it just doesn't work. It’s terrible. You need to practice. I still have terrible talks on the horizon. Hopefully fewer than I had before.\",\n",
