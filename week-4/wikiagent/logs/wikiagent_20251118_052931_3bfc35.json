It is a member of the genus _[Hydrochoerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus \"Hydrochoerus\")_. Its close relatives include [guinea pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavia \"Cavia\") and [rock cavies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerodon \"Kerodon\"), and it is more distantly related to the [agouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agouti \"Agouti\"), the [chinchilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla \"Chinchilla\"), and the [nutria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutria \"Nutria\"). The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as one hundred individuals, but usually live in groups of 10\u201320 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-4)\n\nEtymology\n---------\n\nIts common name is derived from [Tupi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi_language \"Tupi language\")_ka'api\u00fbara_, a complex agglutination of _ka\u00e1_ (leaf) + _p\u00edi_ (slender) + _\u00fa_ (eat) + _ara_ (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning \"one who eats slender leaves\", or \"grass-eater\".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-5) The [genus name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_name \"Genus name\"), _hydrochoerus_, comes from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\")\u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 (_\\_h\u00fddor\\__ \"water\") and \u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (_\\_cho\u00edros\\__ \"pig, hog\") and the species name, _hydrochaeris_, comes from Greek \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 (_\\_h\u00fddor\\__ \"water\") and \u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03c9 (_\\_chairo\\__ \"feel happy, enjoy\").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-msw3-6)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-inDarwin-7)\n\nClassification and phylogeny\n----------------------------\n\nThe capybara and the [lesser capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara \"Lesser capybara\") both belong to the subfamily [Hydrochoerinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerinae \"Hydrochoerinae\") along with the [rock cavies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerodon \"Kerodon\"). The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between _Hydrochoerus_ and _[Kerodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerodon \"Kerodon\")_, the rock cavies,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Rowe_2002-9) supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of [Caviidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caviidae \"Caviidae\").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-msw3-6)\n\nPaleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as _[Neochoerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neochoerus \"Neochoerus\")_,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Vucetich_2005-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Deschamp_2007-11) but more recently have adopted the classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Cerde%C3%B1o_2019-12) The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Vucetich_2005-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Deschamp_2007-11) This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, _Cardiatherium paranense_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Vucetich_2005-10) Among fossil species, the name \"capybara\" can refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern _Hydrochoerus_ than to the \"cardiomyine\" rodents like _Cardiomys_. The fossil genera _Cardiatherium_, _Phugatherium_, _Hydrochoeropsis_, and _Neochoerus_ are all capybaras under that concept.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Cerde%C3%B1o_2019-12)\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n[![Image 7: Taxidermy specimen of a capybara](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Taxidermy_specimen_of_Capybara_%28Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris%29.jpg/250px-Taxidermy_specimen_of_Capybara_%28Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taxidermy_specimen_of_Capybara_(Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris).jpg)\n\n[![Image 8: Skeleton of a capybara](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Capybara_skeleton.jpg/250px-Capybara_skeleton.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capybara_skeleton.jpg)\n\nFrom left to right: Taxidermy specimen and skeleton of a capybara\n\nThe capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) The animal lacks [down hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur#Down_hair \"Fur\"), and its [guard hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur#Guard_hair \"Fur\") differs little from over hair.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-13)\n\nAdult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the [withers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withers \"Withers\"), and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan [llanos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanos \"Llanos\") of 48.9 kg (108 lb).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Arkive-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Smithsonian-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Palm_Beach_Zoo-16) Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r3-17) Also, an 81 kg individual was reported in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2001 or 2002.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-18) The [dental formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_formula \"Dental formula\") is 1.0.1.3 1.0.1.3. Capybaras have slightly [webbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdigital_webbing \"Interdigital webbing\") feet and [vestigial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality \"Vestigiality\") tails.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-enchantedlearning.com-19) Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.\n\nIts [karyotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype \"Karyotype\") has [2n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid \"Diploid\") = 66 and [FN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_number \"Fundamental number\") = 102, meaning it has 66 chromosomes with a total of 102 arms.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-msw3-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8)\n\nEcology\n-------\n\n[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Cattle_tyrant_%28Machetornis_rixosa%29_on_Capybara.jpg/250px-Cattle_tyrant_%28Machetornis_rixosa%29_on_Capybara.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cattle_tyrant_(Machetornis_rixosa)_on_Capybara.jpg)\n\n[Cattle tyrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_tyrant \"Cattle tyrant\") on a capybara\n\nCapybaras are [semiaquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiaquatic \"Semiaquatic\") mammals[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Palm_Beach_Zoo-16) found throughout all countries of South America except [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile \"Chile\").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20) They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Smithsonian-15) as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8)\n\nMany escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly common in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida \"Florida\"), although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-21) In 2011, one specimen was spotted on the [Central Coast of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California) \"Central Coast (California)\").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-22) These escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras inhabited; [late Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene \"Late Pleistocene\") capybaras inhabited Florida[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-23) and _[Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus\\_hesperotiganites \"Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites\")_ in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California \"California\") and _[Hydrochoerus gaylordi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus\\_gaylordi \"Hydrochoerus gaylordi\")_ in [Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada \"Grenada\"), and feral capybaras in North America may actually fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene species.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-24)\n\n### Diet and predation\n\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Capybara_Eating_Hay_11_11_2018.jpg/250px-Capybara_Eating_Hay_11_11_2018.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capybara_Eating_Hay_11_11_2018.jpg)\n\nA capybara eating hay at [Franklin Park Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Park_Zoo \"Franklin Park Zoo\"), Boston, Massachusetts\n\nCapybaras are [herbivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore \"Herbivore\"), grazing mainly on grasses and [aquatic plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_plants \"Aquatic plants\"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Smithsonian-15)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-RevBiolTrop-25) as well as fruit and tree bark.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Palm_Beach_Zoo-16) They are very selective feeders[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Quintana_1998-26) and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Barreto_1998-27) Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Quintana_1998-26) The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-SFZoo-28) Capybaras are [autocoprophagous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagous \"Coprophagous\"),[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-taronga-zoo-29) meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial [gut flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora \"Gut flora\"), to help digest the [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose \"Cellulose\") in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-taronga-zoo-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Lord-Rexford_1994-30) Like other rodents, a capybara's front teeth grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20) their cheek teeth also grow continuously.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-SFZoo-28)\n\nLike its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize [vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C \"Vitamin C\"), and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop [gum disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease \"Periodontal disease\") as a sign of [scurvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy \"Scurvy\").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r2-31)\n\nThe maximum lifespan of the capybara is 8 to 10 years,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r6-32) but in the wild capybaras usually do not live longer than four years because of predation from South American [big cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cats \"Big cats\") such as [jaguars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar \"Jaguar\") and [cougars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar \"Cougar\") and from non-mammalian predators such as [caimans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiman \"Caiman\"), [green anacondas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunectes_murinus \"Eunectes murinus\") and [piranhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha \"Piranha\").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-SoundsandColours-33)\n\n[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Capybara_%28Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris%29_alpha_male.JPG/250px-Capybara_%28Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris%29_alpha_male.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capybara_(Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris)_alpha_male.JPG)\n\nCapybaras have a scent gland on their noses.\n\nCapybaras are known to be [gregarious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregarious \"Gregarious\"). While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10\u201320 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Alho_1987-34) Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Lord-Rexford_1994-30)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Macdonald_1981-35) when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Macdonald_1981-35) They can make dog-like barks[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Lord-Rexford_1994-30) when threatened or when females are herding young.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Murphey_1985-36)\n\nCapybaras have two types of [scent glands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_gland \"Scent gland\"): a morrillo, located on the snout, and [anal glands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_gland \"Anal gland\"). Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent farther by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [estrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus \"Estrus\"). In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Macdonald_1984-37)\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Young_capybaras.jpg/250px-Young_capybaras.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Young_capybaras.jpg)\n\nMother with typical litter of about four pups\n\nWhen in [estrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus \"Estrus\"), the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Herrera_1993-38) In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Lord-Rexford_1994-30) During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Lord-Rexford_1994-30)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Macdonald_1981-35) Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Herrera_1993-38) The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r1-39) Capybara [gestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation \"Gestation\") is 130\u2013150 days, and produces a litter of four young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle\u2014from any female in the group\u2014until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20)[Alloparenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting \"Alloparenting\") has been observed in this species.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Macdonald_1981-35) Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in [Mato Grosso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mato_Grosso \"Mato Grosso\"), Brazil.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8)\n\n### Activities\n\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Smithsonian-15) an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) They also spend time wallowing in mud.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-enchantedlearning.com-19) They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8)\n\n### Communication\n\nCapybaras communicate using barks, chirps, whistles, huffs, and purrs.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-40)\n\nA capybara in captivity, 2009\n\nConservation and human interaction\n----------------------------------\n\nCapybaras are not considered a threatened species;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-iucn_status_19_November_2021-1) their population is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Smithsonian-15)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20) Capybaras are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas,[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-inRich-41) and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, which has the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20)\n\nCapybaras have adapted well to urbanization in South America. They can be found in many areas in zoos and parks,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-SFZoo-28) and may live for 12 years in captivity, more than double their wild lifespan.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-Bristol-20) Capybaras are docile and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their [ticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick \"Tick\") can be [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology) \"Vector (epidemiology)\") to [Rocky Mountain spotted fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever \"Rocky Mountain spotted fever\").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-42) The [European Association of Zoos and Aquaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquaria \"European Association of Zoos and Aquaria\") asked [Drusillas Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drusillas_Park \"Drusillas Park\") in [Alfriston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfriston \"Alfriston\"), [Sussex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex \"Sussex\"), England, to keep the [studbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studbook \"Studbook\") for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-43)\n\nCapybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-SDzoo-44) The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-r4-8) In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during [Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent \"Lent\") and [Holy Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week \"Holy Week\") as the Catholic Church (according to a legend) previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are [generally forbidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_and_abstinence_in_the_Catholic_Church \"Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church\").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-NYSun-45)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-NYTimes2007-46) There is widespread perception in Venezuela that consumption of capybaras is exclusive to rural people.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-NYTimes2007-46)\n\nIn August 2021, Argentine and international media reported that capybaras had been disturbing residents of [Nordelta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordelta \"Nordelta\"), an affluent gated community north of [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires \"Buenos Aires\") built atop the local capybara's preexisting wetland habitat. This inspired social media users to jokingly adopt the capybara as a symbol of [class struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle \"Class struggle\") and [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism \"Communism\").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-TheGuardian_20210822-47) Brazilian Lyme-like [borreliosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borreliosis \"Borreliosis\") likely involves capybaras as reservoirs and _[Amblyomma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyomma \"Amblyomma\")_ and _[Rhipicephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhipicephalus \"Rhipicephalus\")_ ticks as vectors.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-48)\n\nA [Capybara caf\u00e9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cafe#Capybara_caf%C3%A9 \"Animal cafe\") in [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida \"St. Augustine, Florida\"), [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") allows visitors to interact with and give head scratches to the rodents.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-49)\n\nIn popular culture\n------------------\n\n[Izu Shaboten Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Shaboten_Zoo \"Izu Shaboten Zoo\") and other zoos in Japan have created [hot spring baths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen \"Onsen\") for capybaras.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-reuters-50) Video clips of the bathing capybaras have gained millions of views.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-reuters-50) The capybaras have influenced an [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime \"Anime\") character named _Kapibara-san_, and a series of merchandise such as [plush toys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plush_toy \"Plush toy\").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-51)\n\nCapybaras have long been a figure in [meme culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme \"Internet meme\"),[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-52) particularly in the 2020s.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-euronewsmeme-53) In 2022, [Peronists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peronists \"Peronists\") in Argentina presented them as figures of class struggle after the disturbances in Nordelta.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-TheGuardian_20210822-47) Common meme formats pair capybaras with the song \"[After Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Party_(song) \"After Party (song)\")\" by [Don Toliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Toliver \"Don Toliver\").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-euronewsmeme-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_note-54)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n*   _[Josephoartigasia monesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephoartigasia\\_monesi \"Josephoartigasia monesi\")_, an extinct species identified as the largest known rodent ever\n*   [Kurloff cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurloff_cell \"Kurloff cell\"), a type of cell found in capybaras and guinea pigs\n*   _[Capybara Walking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara\\_Walking \"Capybara Walking\")_, a historical animal locomotion film by [Eadweard Muybridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge \"Eadweard Muybridge\")\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_ref-2)** Also referred as **capivara** (in Brazil), **capiguara** (in Bolivia), **chig\u00fcire**, **chig\u00fciro**, or **fercho** (in Colombia and Venezuela), **carpincho** (in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) and **ronsoco** (in Peru).\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.   ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_ref-iucn_status_19_November_2021_1-0)[_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara#cite_ref-iucn_status_19_November_2021_1-1)Reid, F.

capybara\n\nHabitat\n-------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Habitat\")]\n\nThe lesser capybara mainly inhabits areas close to water such as marshes, ponds, and lagoon habitats as these places offer water, which is essential for these capybaras to fulfil their niches' of maintain body temperature homeostasis, provide suitable food, hide from predators, and mate. They were first observed in Pacific river valleys in Panama as early as 1912 as a subspecies of the common capybara. However, after thorough studies on the anatomy and genealogy of them, the lesser capybara was classified as its own species some time in the 1980s.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Currently, this species has expanded its range to parts of Eastern Panama and Western Colombia and Venezuela, just west of the Andes Mountains. The lesser capybara constitutes the northernmost population of any extant capybara species,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:0-2) other than the now [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction \"Extinction\")[_H. hesperotiganites_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus_hesperotiganites \"Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites\") from [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene \"Pleistocene\")[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California \"California\").\n\nDiet\n----\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Diet\")]\n\nLesser capybaras are herbivores that mainly graze on grasses and other aquatic plants. However, during dry seasons when their main source of food is depleted, the lesser capybaras will tend to feed on reeds, grains, melons, and squash. On average, an adult will eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kg) of this food per day. Although not a main part of their diet, lesser capybaras will also eventually [ingest their own feces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia \"Coprophagia\") to gain bacteria that benefits them in breaking down thick fibers eaten.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:1-3)\n\nPhysical description\n--------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Physical description\")]\n\nJust like greater capybaras, the lesser capybara is characterized by short, brown hair, with blunt snouts, four short legs (front legs are smaller than hind), partially webbed feet, small eyes and ears situated high on their head, and a very tiny tail.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:3-4) Compared to greater capybaras, the lesser capybara is generally smaller in size, with adults growing up to 3 feet (90 cm) in length, weighing up to 62 pounds (28 kg), and having a darker brown coat.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Hydrochoerus_isthmius_46666145.jpg/250px-Hydrochoerus_isthmius_46666145.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydrochoerus_isthmius_46666145.jpg)\n\nLesser capybara up close\n\nAdaptations\n-----------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Adaptations\")]\n\nAs animals that are considered prey for many animals, the species is very wary of predators and likes to travel in groups of about 20 cavies.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-5) As a result, the capybaras have adapted to be excellent swimmers and dive regularly in water to avoid predators such as jaguars and anacondas.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:3-4) Having eyes and ears placed high on their heads, the capybaras can see these predators while in the waters. Furthermore, being immersed in water for long periods of time helps the capybaras regulate their body temperature by helping them cool off.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:4-6)\n\nMating\n------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Mating\")]\n\nThe lesser capybara breeds year-round, only in water.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_note-:4-6) Lesser capybara females, when in estrus, will whistle through their nose to attract males. Females have a gestation period of roughly 108 days, and giving birth to litters of about 3 to 4 baby pups.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesser_capybara&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara#cite_ref-iucn_status_19_November_2021_1-0 \"Jump up\")**Delgado, C.; Emmons, L.
