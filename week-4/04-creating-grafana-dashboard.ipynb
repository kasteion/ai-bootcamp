    "# Creating a Grafana Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add a proper monitoring dashboard with Grafana for professional-grade monitoring and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find all the code [here](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/ai-bootcamp-codespace/tree/main/week4/code/monitoring).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Grafana Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the prompt I used to create the Grafana integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "let's create a dashboard with grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "add grafana to docker compose \n",
    "connect to the postgres database from there \n",
    "\n",
    "create multiple dashboards with\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of requests\n",
    "- tokens and cost\n",
    "- display last 5 requests\n",
    "- good/bad feedback in %\n",
    "- anything else you find useful\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generated Files Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "It created the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "├── dashboards\n",
    "│   ├── eval.json\n",
    "│   ├── feedback.json\n",
    "│   └── overview.json\n",
    "└── provisioning\n",
    "    ├── dashboards\n",
    "    │   └── dashboards.yml\n",
    "    └── datasources\n",
    "        └── datasource.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It created 3 dashboards (you can see them in the dashboards folder):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `overview.json`: Main operational dashboard showing request volume, token usage, cost metrics, and system performance over time\n",
    "\n",
    "- `eval.json`: Evaluation metrics dashboard displaying automated assessment results, quality scores, and evaluation trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- `feedback.json`: User feedback analytics showing thumbs up/down ratios, feedback trends, and manual review statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `datasource.yml`: Configures the PostgreSQL connection for Grafana, including database credentials and connection parameters. This allows Grafana to query our log data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dashboards.yml`: Tells Grafana where to find our dashboard definitions and how to provision them automatically when the service starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provisioning approach means our dashboards are automatically available when Grafana starts up, without manual configuration steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "It also added the following service in the compose file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "grafana:\n",
    "  image: grafana/grafana:10.4.7\n",
    "  depends_on:\n",

    "  restart: unless-stopped\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose up grafana\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). User/password is admin/admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the dashboards on the \"Dashboards\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly test our dashboards, we need realistic data. Here's the prompt for generating test data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "create a fake log generator that inserts data to postgres so we can test the dashboard\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://monitoring:monitoring@localhost:5432/monitoring\n",
    "uv run python -m monitoring.fake_data --count 3000 --hours 24\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grafana Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some SQL queries we can use in our Grafana dashboards:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total requests:\n",

    "Total cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_cost)::double precision,0) AS total_cost FROM llm_logs\n",
    "WHERE created_at BETWEEN $__timeFrom() AND $__timeTo();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  $__timeGroupAlias(created_at, $__interval),\n",

    "GROUP BY 1\n",
    "ORDER BY 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests by model:\n",
    "\n",

    "SELECT\n",
    "  model AS \"Model\",\n",
    "  COUNT(*) AS \"Requests\"\n",

    "Last 5 requests:\n",
