This page describes how the **default** algorithm works.\n\nThis applies to: `DataDriftPreset`, `ValueDrift`, `DriftedColumnsCount`.\n\n<Info>\n  This is an explainer page. For API reference, check the guide on [setting data drift parameters](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n</Info>\n\n## How it works\n\nEvidently compares the distributions of the values in a given column (or columns) of the two datasets. You should pass these datasets as **reference** and **current**. Evidently applies several statistical tests and drift detection methods to detect if the distribution has changed significantly. It returns a \"drift detected\" or \"not detected\" result.\n\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column. It is based on:\n\n* column type: categorical, numerical, text data \n\n* the number of observations in the reference dataset\n\n* the number of unique values in the column (n\\_unique)\n\nOn top of this, you can set a rule to detect dataset-level drift based on the number of columns that are drifted.\n\n## Data requirements\n\n**Two datasets**. You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\n\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\n\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values.

This ROC AUC is compared to the ROC AUC of the random classifier at a set percentile. To ensure the result is statistically meaningful, we repeat the calculation 1000 times with randomly assigned target class probabilities. This produces a distribution with a mean of 0.5. We then take the 95th percentile (default) of this distribution and compare it to the ROC-AUC score of the classifier. If the classifier score is higher, we consider the data drift to be detected. You can also set a different percentile as a parameter.\n</Info>\n\nIf the drift is detected, Evidently will also calculate the\u00a0**top features of the domain classifier**.

It returns a \"drift detected\" or \"not detected\" result.\n\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column. It is based on:\n\n* column type: categorical, numerical, text data \n\n* the number of observations in the reference dataset\n\n* the number of unique values in the column (n\\_unique)\n\nOn top of this, you can set a rule to detect dataset-level drift based on the number of columns that are drifted.\n\n## Data requirements\n\n**Two datasets**.
