    "# Fully Open-Source Observability with Pydantic Logfire and Jaeger\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we used Logfire to send data to the Logfire backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logfire SDK is open source, and you can use it to export data to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logfire platform (the UI and backend) is closed source.\n",

    "- Platform: https://pydantic.dev/logfire\n",

    "- Alternative backends guide: https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/alternative-backends/\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation gives you flexibility - you can use the Logfire SDK with any observability backend that supports OpenTelemetry.\n",
