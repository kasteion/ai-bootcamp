    "# LLM Observability with Pydantic Logfire\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we used our own logger and displayed the logs in Grafana. This is a good approach because it gives you a lot of flexibility in what to track, and what to do with this data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at tools that can help with some of these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll look at Pydantic Logfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Pydantic Logfire\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pydantic Logfire](https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/) is an observability platform developed by the Pydantic team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the platform is a commercial product, not open-source. But the SDK is open-source. We will use the platform now because it's very simple, and later we will explore open-source alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding OpenTelemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, Logfire uses OTel (OpenTelemetry). OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized way to collect, process, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) from applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's become the industry standard for observability, allowing you to instrument your code once and send data to any compatible backend. You can read more about its application to generative AI here: https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/otel-generative-ai/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Logfire\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an account at https://logfire.pydantic.dev/\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new project in your Logfire dashboard\n",
    "2. Generate a write token for your project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing Secrets with .env\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use dotenv for managing the secrets (feel free to use any other approach):\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a .env file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "LOGFIRE_TOKEN=\"your-logfire-write-token\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add .env to your .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing secrets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    ".env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Logfire and dotenv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv add logfire python-dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrating Logfire\n",

    "Add this to your application:"

    "The `instrument_pydantic_ai()` function automatically adds observability to all PydanticAI operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Running with Logfire\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your application as normal. Voilà! Now all your PydanticAI calls are automatically forwarded to Logfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete traces of agent interactions\n",
    "- Token usage and costs\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I'm not affiliated with them, but I think it's a great product (just like other offerings from the Pydantic team)."
